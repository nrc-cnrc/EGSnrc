# We want to be able to build 3 different targets:
#    executable with optimization turned on (default)
#    executable without optimization
#    executable with debug symbols included
# The following is for distinguishing between the 3
#   $(WHAT) gets appended to the user code name. It is empty for a default 
#           build (optimization turned on), is = _noopt for no optimization
#           and _debug for debug symbols included.
#   $(OPTLEVEL_F) is the optimization or debug flags passed to the 
#                 fortran compiler. Depending on the target (opt, noopt or 
#                 debug), it gets replaced with the appropriate compiler 
#                 flags.
#   $(OPTLEVEL_C) is not used right now 
# FOPT and COPT are defined in the config file EGS_CONFIG
#

failed_message = "______Operation failed______"

# The following is the rule for building the executable
#   The first line says that the executable is dependent on the 
#   fortran file. Because of this dependence, make will rebuild the 
#   executable whenever the prerequisite (the fortran file) is more 
#   recent than the executable using the rule on the second line 
#   (note the leading tab!!! without it it will not work)
# F77 and FLFLAGS are defined in the configuration file.
# OPTLEVEL_F is set depending on whether we build optimized, noopt or 
# debug executable.
# $@ is an automatic make variable and gets replaced with the name 
# of the target that initiated the invocation of this rule 
# ( $(EXECUTABLE) in this case, which expands to something like 
#  $HOME/egsnrc/bin/Linux/cavrznrc)
# So, the actual command passed by make to the sehll will look 
# something like
#   g77 -O3 -o /usr/people/iwan/egsnrc/bin/Linux/dosrznrc dosrznrc_Linux.F

# The -o7 option tells the mortran compiler to write the resulting fortran 
# output to the file name given by the next argument (7 us the unit mortran 
# uses for that => -o7)
