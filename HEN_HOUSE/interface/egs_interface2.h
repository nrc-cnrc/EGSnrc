/*! \file egs_interface2.h
  \brief This file defines the C/C++ interface to the EGSnrc mortran
         back-end
  \IK

  C/C++-structures are defined for the most commonly used mortran
  common blocks such as the \link EGS_Stack particle stack \endlink,
  the \link EGS_Bounds transport threshold energies\endlink, etc.
  The general naming convention is that for a common block
  \c XXX the C-structure will be called EGS_Xxx. For a detailed
  description of EGSnrc common blocks see PIRS-701. Note, however,
  that various common blocks are replaced in \c egs_c_interface2.macros
  to remove all dependences on the geometry and to combine
  various transport parameter otpions into a single common
  block so that fewer common blocks need to be "exported".

  Not all
  common are "exported". If a definition of a C-structure for
  a given common block that you need to access in your
  user code is missing, simply follow the way this file
  defines the structures and define it in your user code.
  In principle the mortran common blocks can be accessed
  directly from C/C++. However, due to name mangling of Fortran
  symbols undertaken by the Fortran compiler, a common block
  named \c xxx may result in a symbol called <code>xxx, xxx_, xxx__,
  XXX, XXX_</code> or \c XXX__, depending on the name mangling scheme
  used by the Fortran compiler. This is handled by the macros
  \c %F77_OBJ(name,NAME) and \c F77_OBJ_(name,NAME) defined in
  \c %egs_config1.h, which is created during the installation of
  the EGSnrc system. With these macros one could access \em e.g. the
  particle energies using
  \verbatim
  F77_OBJ(stack,STACK).E
  \endverbatim
  Because the above is quite tedious, this file also defines the
  addresses of the mortran common blocks as pointers to
  the corresponding C-structures with the general naming convention that
  \c the_xxx points to the common block \c XXX, \em e.g.
  \c the_stack points to the \c STACK common block,
  \c the_bounds to the \c BOUNDS common block, etc.

  This file also provides declarations of various EGSnrc mortran functions
  and subroutines and corresponding pre-processor macros for
  easier access (the name mangling also applies to function names
  and therefore to call the EGSnrc subroutine \c %shower(), one must
  use \c F77_OBJ(shower,SHOWER)() ). Most of these functions are
  only relevant for developing EGSnrc applications in C. For
  EGSnrc C++ applications it is much easier to derive from the
  EGS_SimpleApplication or EGS_AdvancedApplication classes, which
  make the direct access to most of these functions unnecessary.

/*! \brief A structure corresponding to the EGSnrc transport threshold
  energies common block \c BOUNDS

    Note that the original \c BOUNDS common block contains
    transport threshold energies on a region-by-region basis.
    To remove this dependence on the geometry (which determines
    the number of regions), \c BOUNDS is replaced with a
    new definition in \c egs_c_interface2.macros removing the
    region dependence but introducing \c ecut_new and \c pcut_new.
    To obtain the original functionality of a region-by-region
    threshold enerty variation, these variables can be set
    to the desired values each time the transport of a new particle
    begins and each time a particle enters a new region.
    The best way to do this is to set up that the \c %ausgab()
    function is called before a step is taken (\em i.e. \c iarg=0)
    and to set \c ecut_new or \c pcut_new to the desired value
    in \c %ausgab(), if a new region will be entered after the step.
    In addition, \c ecut or \c pcut must be set to the actual value
    in the current region when the transport of a new particle
    begins. When the transport of a new particle begins, the
    function egsStartParticle is called. User codes written in
    C must provide an implementation of this function. User
    codes in C++ deriving from EGS_AdvancedApplication must
    implement the \link EGS_AdvancedApplication::startNewParticle()
    startNewParticle() \endlink function. Region-by-region variation
    of the transport thresholds is not possible in simple
    C++ applications deriving from EGS_SimpleApplication.
    Note that when setting transport threshold energies you
    mist make sure that they are higher then, or equal to,
    the particle production threshold energies \c AE (electrons) and
    \c AP (photons), otherwise program crashes are likely.
    \c AE and \c AP are the particle production thresholds that are
    determined by the PEGS data being used. They are available from
    struct EGS_Thresh for all media in the simulation geometry.
