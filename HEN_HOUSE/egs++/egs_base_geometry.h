    The following describes the implementation of a box geometry that
    can serve as a guide to users for developing their own geometry classes.

    Our box geometry class will describe a parallelepiped of a user
    defined size that defines a single region filled with 1 medium.

    As our geometry must be derived from EGS_BaseGeometry, we include
    its header file. We also want to be able to transform the box
    from being centered about the origin and having its faces parallel
    to the x-, y- and z-axis to any other location and/or
    orientation. For that we will employ \link EGS_AffineTransform
    affine transformations \endlink and therefore also include the
    transformations header file:
    \skipline #include
    \until #include
    As with other geometries, we will be compiling our box class into
    a shared library. We have to therefore mark the symbols that
    will be exported from the library. For this purpose we define
    a macro \c EGS_BOX_EXPORT, which we define like this
    \until #define EGS_BOX_LOCAL
    \until #define EGS_BOX_LOCAL
    \until #endif
    \until #endif
    We are now ready to develop our box geometry class by deriving
    from EGS_BaseGeometry:
    \until public:
    The data members <code>ax,ay,az</code> are for the box size,
    the \c type static data member will be set to "EGS_Box" and used
    and the \c T data member will point to the affine transformation
    associated with boxes not located about the origin and/or rotated
    boxes. We now need a constructor and a destructor for box objects.
    We provide two different constructors: one for boxes where all
    sides have the same size (\em i.e. cubes)
    \until };
    and one for boxes with 3 different sides
    \until };
    In the destructor we simply deallocate the memory used by the
    affine transformation, if there was a transformation defined:
    \until };
    We can now start implementing the required geometry methods
    \link EGS_BaseGeometry::isInside() isInside() \endlink,
    \link EGS_BaseGeometry::isWhere() isWhere() \endlink,
    \link EGS_BaseGeometry::howfar() howfar() \endlink and
    \link EGS_BaseGeometry::hownear() hownear() \endlink.

    A point is inside a box about the origin if its x-position
    is between \c -ax/2 and \c ax/2, its y-position between
    \c -ay/2 and \c ay/2, etc. For a transformed box, the easiest way
    to determine if the position is inside the box is to apply the
    inverse transformation to the position and to then use the simple
    method for boxes about the origin. The \c isInside implementation
    therefore looks like this
    \until };
    (multiplying the position vector with \c *T from the right is an
    operation equivalent to transforming \c x with the inverse of \c *T)

    The implementation of the \c isWhere method is very easy: as we have
    a single region this function should return 0 if the position is
    inside and -1 if it is outside:
    \until };

    The implementation of the \c howfar method is also easiest if
    we first transform the position and direction to a frame where
    the box is centered about the origin and its sides are parallel
    to the axis:
    \skip int howfar
    \until if( T )
    The \c howfar logic is different for positions inside (\em i.e.
    \c ireg=0 ) and outside. For inside points, we must calculate the
    distances to the x-planes, y-planes and z-planes from the transformed
    point \c xp
    along the transformed direction \c up and take the minimum
    \c t1 of the three.
    If \c t1 is less than the intended step \c t,
    we must set \c t to \c t1 and return -1 (\em i.e. the particle
    will exit the box at the end of the step). If \c normal is not
    \c null, our \c howfar function is being called from the visualization
    utility and we must also calculate the normal of the plane being
    intersected to exit the box with the normal pointing towards the
    position of the particle. The implementation therefore looks like this
    \until return inew
    \until }
    When the position is outside, the logic is
    -# if the particle intersects the top or bottom side, check if
       the intersection point is between the left-right and east-west
       sides.
    -# If yes, this is the position where the trajectory is entering
       the box => return the required information
    -# If no, repeat 1-2 for left-right sides and if necessary for the
       east-west sides.
    -# If all of the above fails, the particle does not enter the box.

    The code is lengthy and not reproduced here.

    The next step is the implementation of the \c hownear function.
    As with the other methods, we first inverse transform the position
    and then calculate the minimum distance to a box about the origin
    \skip hownear
    \until xp
    If the position is inside the boxe (\em i.e. \c ireg=0), the
    minimum distance to a boundary is the minimum distance to any
    of the 6 faces:
    \until }
    If the position is outside, the algorithm is slightly more
    difficult and is left to the reader to understand from the
    implementation:
    \until };

    We reimplement the \c getType function to return \c type so that
    the type of our geometry class is known:
    \until };

    We also reimplement the \link EGS_BaseGeometry::printInfo()
    printInfo() \endlink function so that users of our
    geometry class can get a better description of the geometry object:
    \until };
    The actual implementation of \c printInfo is in the egs_box.cpp
    file, which includes \c egs_box.h and \c egs_input.h:
    \dontinclude geometry/egs_box/egs_box.cpp
    \until egs_input
    The latter is necessary to gain access to the definition of the
    EGS_Input class that is needed in the \c createGeometry function
    (see below). The \c printInfo implementation is simple:
    \skip ::printInfo
    \until }

    We also need to declare the static data member \c type
    \until string
    According to verious sources, compilers can produce better code
    if text strings are static and local to the library. Hence,
    we define the various error messages and the key we will be
    using to define the size of a box object as such:
    \until ebox_key1

    The remaining task now is to provide a C-style function named
    \c createGeometry for the box
    shared library that will be used to dynamically create box objects
    based on the information stored in an EGS_Input object.
    \until EGS_BOX_EXPORT
    Just to be sure, we check that \c input is not \c null and issue
    a warning and return \c null if it is:
    \until egsWarning
    We then check if the input object contains a <code>box size</code>
    property
    \until int err =
    and if it doesn't (indicated by \c err not being zero), issue
    a warning and return \c null:
    \until }
    Next we check if the input contains a definition if a transformation for
    our box geometry:
    \until EGS_AffineTransform
    Depending on whether there was one or three values to the
    <code>box size</code> key, we use the corresponding constructor
    to create the new box object, but refuse to create it if
    there was some other number of values (because, \em e.g., the user
    made a mistake in the input file):
    \until }
    We must now delete the affine transformation pointed to by \c t as
    the box object has made its own copy in the constructor
    \until delete
    We then use the \c setName and \c setMedia functions inherited from
    EGS_BaseGeometry to set the name of the newly created box and fill
    it with a medium
    \until result
    to then return the box
    \until }
    \until }

    Based on this \c createGeometry implementation, users will be able
    to use our box geometry class by having the following input in
    the input file
    \verbatim
    :start geometry:
        name = some_name
        box size = 3.5 1 7
        :start transformation:
            input defining the transformation
        :stop transformation
        :start media input:
            media = H2O
        :stop media input
    :stop geometry:
    \endverbatim
    The transformation related input can be of course missing in which
    case the box will be centered about the origin and has its faces
    parallel to the x-, y- and z-axis.

    If we would have been nice to the users of our box geometry class,
    we could have provided an easier way for defining the medium of
    the box by re-implementing the \link
    EGS_BaseGeometry::setMedia(EGS_Input *) setMedia() \endlink
    function, \em e.g. something along these lines:
    \verbatim
    void EGS_Box::setMedia(EGS_Input *inp) {
        string medname; int err = inp->getInput("medium",medname);
        if( !err ) setMedium(medname);
    }
    \endverbatim
    That way, the user could define the medium of the box by simply
    using
    \verbatim
    medium = H2O
    \endverbatim
    instead of <code>:start media input: ... :stop media input:</code>
    which is necessary for geometries with several regions and potentialy
    different media and therefore provided as default implementation.

    The final step is to provide a Makefile for our geometry DSO.
    \dontinclude geometry/egs_box/Makefile
    We include the config files containing various definitions for
    the make system:
    \skipline EGS_CONFIG
    \until my_machine
    We then must add the \c BUILD_BOX_DLL macro to the list of defined
    macros,
    \until DEFS
    set the name of the DSO,
    \until library
    define the source files needed to create the DSO,
    \until lib_files
    and tell the make system that our class depends on the
    egs_transformations.h header file,
    \until extra_dep
    We can then use the generic rules for building the DSO:
    \until include
    and because our only object file needed to build the library
    depends on \c %egs_box.cpp and \c %egs_box.h, we can also
    use the generic dependence rule
    \until make_depend
    That's all.


    Here is the complete source code of the EGS_Box class.<br>
    The header file:
    \include geometry/egs_box/egs_box.h
    The .cpp file:

    The Makefile:

/* \example geometry/example1/geometry_example1.cpp

  Suppose that you frequently use the same complex geometry and you
  are tired of always having to include the long definition of this geometry
  into your input file. In this case it may be worthwhile to implement your
  own geometry DSO that constructs the geometry of interest with very little
  input (or even no input at all). This example illustrates how to do this
  programatically.

  As this is just an example, the geometry we will be constructing is not very
  complex: it consists of a cylinder inscribed in a sphere and the sphere
  inscribed in a box as shown in the figure ???. We want to be able to define
  the media of the cylinder, the sphere and the box in the input file
  (so that we can easily use different PEGS data sets, for example). All other
  dimensions of our example geometry are fixed.

  To create our new geometry, we make a new subdirectory in the egspp
  geometries subdirectory called \c example1. To be able to use the
  predefined rules for building geometry libraries we create a dummy
  header file \c %geometry_example1.h that does nothing else except to
  define the \c EGS_EXAMPLE1_DLL
  macro:
  \include geometry/example1/geometry_example1.h
  and put the implementation in \c %geometry_example1.cpp.
  \dontinclude geometry/example1/geometry_example1.cpp
  In this file we include the just created header file and the EGS_Input
  class header file to get access to its definition,
  needed in the \c %createGeometry() function (see below):
  \until egs_input
  We also need the declarations of the various geometry classes that we
  will use to construct our geometry:
  \until egs_envelope_geometry.h
  We then define the dimensions of the various geometrical structures
  \until box_size

  The remaining task is to implement a C-style \c %createGeometry() function
  exported by the DSO
  \until EGS_EXAMPLE1_EXPORT
  We check that the input object is valid and return \c null if it is not
  \until }
  We then look for a definition of the cylinder medium and print a warning if
  such a definition is missing:
  \skipline cyl_medium
  \until }
  We repeat basically the same code to obtain the sphere and the box
  media
  \until }
  \until }
  and return \c null if any of the media definition was missing:
  \until if
  Now we are ready to construct our geometry. We first create a set of
  parallel z-planes
  \until EGS_ZProjector
  As the planes will only be used by our geometry object internally, we don't
  care how the plane set is named and therefore give it a name using
  the static function EGS_BaseGeometry::getUniqueName().
  In a similar way we create a set of z-cylinders consisting of a single
  cylinder
  \until ZProjector
  and make a closed cylinder modeled as a 2D-geometry from the planes and the
  cylinder surface:
  \until getUniqueName
  We then set the medium of the cylinder
  \until setMedium
  The next step is to create the sphere as a set of spheres consisting of
  a single sphere
  \until getUniqueName
  and to fill it with the sphere medium defined in the input
  \until setMedium
  We then use an envelope geometry to inscribe the cylinder into the just
  created sphere:
  \until getUniqueName
  The next step is to create the outer box and fill it with the box medium
  defined in the input
  \until setMedium
  (as our geometry will always be centered about the origin, we pass a
   \c null affine transformation to the constructor of the box).
  We now inscribe the \c the_sphere geometry object (which is the sphere
  with the cylinder inscribed in it) into the just created box using
  again an envelope geometry,
  \until the_box
  set the name of \c the_box from the input using the inherited
  \link EGS_BaseGeometry::setName(EGS_Input*) setName() \endlink method,
  \until setName
  and return a pointer to the just created geometry
  \until }
  \until }
  That's all.

  In the Makefile we include the egspp make config files,
  \dontinclude geometry/example1/Makefile
  \skipline EGS_CONFIG
  \until my_machine
  set the C-preprocessor defines to the standard set of defines
  for our egspp configuration,
  \until DEFS
  define the name of our DSO,
  \until library
  and and the set of files needed to build the DSO
  \until lib_files
  Because we are using planes, cylinders, spheres, a ND-geometry, a box
  geometry and an envelope geometry to construct our geometry, we must
  link against the geometry libraries containing these geometries.
  We accomplish this by seting the \c link2_libs make variable to the
  list of needed libraries
  \until egs_genvelope
  We then include the standard rules for building a DSO
  \until include
  and set the dependencies of our object files
  \until make_depend
  We must also add the dependencies on the various geometry header files
  that we are including
  \until egs_envelope_geometry.h
  We can now build our geometry DSO by typing \c make and use
  it by including input like this in the input file
  \verbatim
  :start geometry:
      library = geometry_example1
      name = some_name
      cylinder medium = H2O521ICRU
      sphere medium = AL521ICRU
      box medium = AIR521ICRU
  :stop geometry:
  \endverbatim
  It is worth noting that we could have constructed this geometry as the
  \link EGS_UnionGeometry union \endlink of the cylinder pointed to
  by \c the_cyl, the sphere pointed to by \c sphere and the
  box pointed to by \c box. However, such an implementation would be
  much slower at run time because for each invocation of a geometry
  method the union will have to interogate the geometry methods of all
  3 objects. In contrast, the envelope geometry will be checking only
  against the box for points outside of the box, the box and the sphere for
  points inside the box but outside the sphere, the sphere and the cylinder
  for points inside the sphere but outside the cylinder and the cylinder
  only for points inside the cylinder.

  The complete source code of this example geometry is below
  \include geometry/example1/Makefile
  \include geometry/example1/geometry_example1.h

/* \example geometry/example2/geometry_example2.cpp

  This example illustrates how to create the same geometry as
  described in
  <a href="geometry_2example1_2geometry__example1_8cpp-example.html">
  this example</a> but using EGS_BaseGeometry::createSingleGeometry
  to create the geometry from definitions stored in an EGS_Input objects.
  The header file is similar as in the previous
  <a href="geometry_2example1_2geometry__example1_8cpp-example.html">
  example</a>, but unlike in the previous example we don't need the
  header files of the various geometries being used.
  Our implementation consists of a single C-style function
  \c %createGeometry()
  \dontinclude geometry/example2/geometry_example2.cpp
  \skipline createGeometry
  As with the previous
  <a href="geometry_2example1_2geometry__example1_8cpp-example.html">
  example</a>, we check for valid input and extract the
  media of the cylinder, sphere and the box from the input
  \until !ok
  We will create the various geometry objects needed in our composite
  geometry by passing EGS_Input objects containing geometry definitions
  to the EGS_BaseGeometry::createSingleGeometry function.
  We start with the set of planes needed to close the cylinder.
  We first create an EGS_Input object named \c geometry that we will
  be passing to the geometry creation function:
  \until plane_input
  We then create properties for the library name,
  \until plane_library
  the plane-set type,
  \until plane_type
  the name of the set of planes,
  \until plane_name
  and the plane positions
  \until plane_positions
  and add them to the geometry definition
  \until plane_positions
  We then create the set of planes
  \until createSingleGeometry
  The definition and creation of the set of cylinders is very similar
  \until createSingleGeometry
  We now make a closed cylinder as a 2D geometry
  \until createSingleGeometry
  and set its medium
  \until setMedium
  In a similar fashion we create the sphere, use an envelope geometry
  to inscribe the cylinder into the sphere, create a box, and use again
  an envelope to inscribe the sphere into the box. The code is not shown
  here as it is lengthy and boring but can be found at the end of this page.
  Finally we set the name of the newly created geometry \c the_box and
  return it:
  \skipline the_box->setName
  \until }
  \until }

  The Makefile is now simpler as we don't need to link against the
  various geometry DSOs as they are loaded dynamically at run time
  by the EGS_BaseGeometry::createSingleGeometry function and
  our implementation also does not depend on the header files of the
  various geometry classes being used:
  \include geometry/example2/Makefile

  For completeness here is the header file:
  \include geometry/example2/geometry_example2.h
  and the complete implementation:
