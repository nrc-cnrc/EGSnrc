  this class.

  \ingroup Sources
  \ingroup egspp_main

  Particle sources in the EGSnrc C++ class library are classes derived
  from the base source class and compiled into dynamic shared objects
  (a.k.a. DLLs) that get dynamically loaded at run time as specified by
  the sources property <code>source definition</code>
  (see \ref Sources). The base source defines the interface to a source
  object. The main method is getNextParticle() which returns the parameter
  of a single particle distributed according to some probability distribution.
  Additional functions that must be implemented by derived classes are
  - getEmax(): returns the maximum energy of the source
  - getFluence(): returns the fluence the source has emitted so far
  - getSourceDescription(): returns a string describing the source
  - storeState(), setState(), resetCounter(), addState(): these are functions
    needed for restarting calculations or combining the results of parallel
    runs

  \todo Add time dependence

/*! \example sources/egs_point_source/egs_point_source.cpp

A point source is a special case of an
\link EGS_IsotropicSource isotropic source \endlink.
Due to its simplicity, it provides a good example for discussing
the implementation of a new source class.

The point source header file \c %egs_point_source.h includes
the base source header file, the header file of the EGS_Vector
class to gain access to the methods manipulating 3D vectors, and
the random number generator (RNG) header file to get access to the
declaration of the various RNG methods needed to sample particles
\dontinclude sources/egs_point_source/egs_point_source.h
\skipline egs_base_source.h
\until egs_rndm.h
It then defines a macro \c EGS_POINT_SOURCE_EXPORT that will be used
to mark DSO symbols as exports when building the point source
DSO and as imports when linking against the DSO:
\until EGS_POINT_SOURCE_LOCAL
\until EGS_POINT_SOURCE_LOCAL
\until endif
\until endif

We derive the point source class from EGS_BaseSimpleSource
instead of EGS_BaseSource because a point source is a "simple"
source (\em i.e consists of a spectrum and an energy-independent
probability distribution for position and direction):
\until public:
The private variables \c xo (point source position) and
\c valid will be set in the constructors (see below).
We provide two methods for constructing a point source: directly
by passing a charge, a spectrum, a source position and a name
to the constructor,
\until };
and from the information provided by an EGS_Input object
\until EGS_Input
The implementation of the second constructor is in the
.cpp file and will be discussed below.

The main method that must be implemented in a derived simple source
class is \link EGS_BaseSimpleSource::getPositionDirection
getPositionDirection() \endlink to sample the position and direction
of a single particle and to set its statistical weight
\skipline getPositionDirection
\until {
Sampling the particle position for a point source is easy: it is simply
the point source position
\until xo
Sampling the direction is also easy: one samples \f$u_z\f$ uniformely
between -1 and 1, picks a random azimuthal angle \f$\phi\f$ between
0 and \f$2 \pi\f$ and sets \f$ u_x = \sqrt{1 - u_z^2} \cos \phi,
u_y = \sqrt{1 - u_z^2} \sin \phi\f$:
\until else
The statistical weight of the particle is always unity
\until };

The next function to implement is \c %getFluence(), which should return
the particle "fluence" emitted so far by the source. We arbitrarily
decide to define the "fluence" of our point source to be the
number of particles emitted by the source (we also could have
picked the number of particles per unit solid angle or real fluence
at a certain distance from the source) and therefore the
\c %getFluence() implementation is very easy:
\until };
Here, \c count is a protected data member inhereted from
EGS_BaseSimpleSource, which is initialized to zero in the
simple source constructor and is incremented by one in each
invocation of the \link EGS_BaseSimpleSource::getNextParticle()
getNextParticle() \endlink function.

The next task is to implement the functions that store the state
of a point source object to a data stream and restore the state
from a data stream. This is needed for the ability to restart
simulations. Because our source class is very simple, no
data needs to be stored/restored in addition to the data already
stored/restored by EGS_BaseSource and EGS_BaseSimpleSource.
The implementation of these functions is therefore extremely simple:
\until setFluenceState

The next step in the header file is to provide a \c %isValid
function, which should return \c true, if the source object is
valid and \c false otherwise (\em e.g. it does not have a spectrum).
\c %isValid() is needed so that the \c %createSource() function that
must be provided by the source DSO (see below) can be implemented by
simply using the template createSourceTemplate():
\until isValid()

The final step in the point source declaration is to specify a
protected function that will be used to set up the source type
and description
\until };

The \c %egs_point_source.cpp file provides implementation of the
constructor that creates a point source object from information
stored in an EGS_Input object, the \c %setUp() function and
the C-style source creation function \c %createSource() that must be provided
by each source DSO. It includes the point source header file and
the input object header file
\dontinclude egs_point_source.cpp
\skipline egs_point_source.h
\until egs_input.h

The point source constructor calls the
\link EGS_BaseSimpleSource::EGS_BaseSimpleSource(EGS_Input*,EGS_ObjectFactory*)
 base simple source \endlink constructor passing the input as argument
\until {
This sets the name of the source from the \c name key, sets the charge
from a \c charge key and constructs the spectrum from the information
in a \c spectrum composite property using
EGS_BaseSpectrum::createSpectrum(). The only task remaining for a
complete point source definition is to determine the position of
the source:
\until int err
The position was successfully set if \c err=0 and the number of inputs
to the \c position key is exactly 3 (defining a 3D position), otherwise
a warning is issued and the source is set to be invalid:
\until }
The source type and description is then set using \c %setUp().
\until }

The implementation of the \c %setUp function sets the type string
to "EGS_PointSource" and the description string to a short sentence
constructed from the charge and spectrum type:
\until }
\until }

The \c %createSource C-style function implementation simply uses the
createSourceTemplate() function:
\until }
\until }
The conditions for being able to use createSourceTemplate() to construct
a source are
- The source provides a constructor that takes pointers to an EGS_Input
  object and an object factory as arguments
- The source provides a \c %isValid() function returning a
  boolean value.

This completes the implementation of our point source class.

The Makefile is very similar to the Makefile of a geometry DSO
(see \em e.g. <a href="geometry_2example2_2geometry__example2_8cpp-example.html">
this example</a>): we include the egspp config setting for the make system,
\dontinclude sources/egs_point_source/Makefile
\skipline EGS_CONFIG
\until my_machine
set the pre-processor defines to include the \c BUILD_POINT_SOURCE_DLL
macro,
\until DEFS
define the DSO name and files needed to build the DSO,
\until lib_files
set the dependences to be set of header files common for all sources,
\until
extra_dep
include the rules for building a DSO,
\until include
and make the dependences take effect
\until make_depend

We can now build our point source DSO by typing \c make and use it
for simulations by including input such as
\verbatim
:start source:
    library = egs_points_source
    name = some_name
    charge = -1
    :start spectrum:
       definition of a spectrum
    :stop spectrum:
    position = 15 -3 7
:stop source:
\endverbatim
in the source definition section of the input file.

This is the complete Makefile:
\include sources/egs_point_source/Makefile
This is the complete header file:
\include sources/egs_point_source/egs_point_source.h
This is the complete source file:
