/*! \brief An isotropic source

  \ingroup Sources

An isotropic source is a source that delivers particles of a given
\c charge with directions uniformly distributed in \f$4 \pi\f$ emitted from
\link EGS_BaseShape any shape \endlink with \link EGS_BaseSpectrum any spectrum.
\endlink
It is defined most simply using the following input:
\verbatim
:start source:
    library = egs_isotropic_source
    name = some_name
    :start shape:
        definition of the shape
    :stop shape:
    :start spectrum:
        definition of the spectrum
    :stop spectrum:
    charge = -1 or 0 or 1 for electrons or photons or positrons
    min theta = 80  [degree] (optional)
    max theta = 100 [degree] (optional)
    min phi   = 80  [degree] (optional)
    max phi   = 100 [degree] (optional)
    geometry = some_name          # Optional, only particles inside the geometry
                                  # or inside some of its regions are generated.
    region selection = IncludeAll # Optional, only for a valid geometry defined as above.
                                  # Also possible: ExcludeAll, IncludeSelected, ExcludeSelected.
                                  # Defaults to IncludeAll.
    selected regions = ir1,...    # If IncludeSelected or ExcludeSelected above, then user must
                                  # enter the desired regions to be excluded or included. If
                                  # no region provided, region selection switches to:
                                  #        IncludeAll if IncludeSelected
                                  #        ExcludeAll if ExcludeSelected
:stop source:
\endverbatim

It is also possible to generate source particles from a more complex shape
by including or excluding geometry regions. This is done by providing
the \c geometry name to operate on, a <tt>region selection</tt> mode, and
<tt>selected regions</tt> for the region selection operation. The <tt>selected
regions</tt> tag is necessary and used only for \c IncludeSelected and
\c ExcludeSelected modes.

The available region selection modes are described below. A particle is
generated within the defined shape uniformly, and kept only if it meets the
corresponding condition:

\li <tt>IncludeAll</tt> - particle is inside \c geometry
\li <tt>ExcludeAll</tt> - particle is NOT inside \c geometry
\li <tt>IncludeSelected</tt> - particle is inside \c geometry AND in one of
<tt>selected regions</tt>
\li <tt>ExcludeSelected</tt> - particle is not inside \c geometry OR not in
one of <tt>selected regions</tt>

\verbatim
:start source:
    library = egs_isotropic_source
    name = some_name
    geometry = a geometry to modify particle generation (optional)
    region selection = IncludeAll or ExcludeAll or IncludeSelected or ExcludeSelected (optional)
    selected regions = regions to use (only for IncludeSelected or ExcludeSelected)
    :start shape:
        definition of the shape to generate particles within
    :stop shape:
    :start spectrum:
        definition of the spectrum
    :stop spectrum:
    charge = -1 or 0 or 1 for electrons or photons or positrons
    min theta = 80  [degree] (optional)
    max theta = 100 [degree] (optional)
    min phi = 80  [degree] (optional)
    max phi = 100 [degree] (optional)
:stop source:
\endverbatim

It is worth noting that the functionality of source 3 in the RZ series
of user codes or source 6 in DOSXYZnrc can be reproduced with
the isotropic source from the EGSnrc C++ class library.

Here is an example of two spheres in a box emitting isotropic photons. Only
the geometry and source blocks are provided:
