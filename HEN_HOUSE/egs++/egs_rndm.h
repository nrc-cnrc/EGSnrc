 *
 * \ingroup egspp_main
 *
 * A random number generator (RNG) is a central part of every Monte Carlo
 * simulation. In order to have the possibility of using different
 * RNGs, the egspp class library defines a RNG as an abstract class.
 * However, for the sake of efficiency, the main method for drawing
 * random numbers getUniform() is implemented as an inline function, which
 * returns the next number in an array of random numbers, possibly after
 * calling the pure virtual method fillArray() to fill the array with
 * random numbers. Appart from getUniform(), which returns a random number
 * uniformely distributed between zero (inclusive) and one (exclusive),
 * EGS_RandomGenerator implements some frequently needed algorithms such
 * as picking a random azimuthal angle ( getAzimuth() ) angle and picking
 * a Gaussian distributed number ( getGaussian() ).
 *
 * \todo Should not EGS_RandomGenerator be derived from EGS_Object,
 * so that dynamically loading RNG DSOs is automatically implemented?
