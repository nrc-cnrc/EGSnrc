/*! \brief Base class for advanced EGSnrc C++ applications

  \ingroup egspp_main

  The recommended method for developing EGSnrc C++ applications is to
  derive an application class from one of the advanced application classes.
  At this point, the EGS_AdvancedApplication class,
  which is based on the mortran version of EGSnrc,
  is the only class available.
  However, when EGSnrc is reimplemented in C++ there will be a corresponding
  EGS_AdvancedCppApplication class. The EGS_Application class implements
  all functionality that is independent on the details of the physics functions
  implementation (mortran \em vs C++). The motivation behind this approach
  is that EGSnrc applications developed for the mortran back-end should
  work with as little change as possible with a future EGSnrc version
  written in C++.

  <p>EGS_Application and EGS_AdvancedApplication implement a large portion
  of the work needed to develop an EGSnrc user code. Many of the functions
  implementing particular aspects of the initialization, the simulation
  loop, the storing of intermediate results, etc., are declared virtual
  to provide a high level of flexibility, but in general only very few
  of the virtual functions must be re-implemented in derived classes.
  The following is a brief recipe for developing an EGSnrc application
  derived from EGS_AdvancedApplication. For the sake of a concrete example
  we will assume that the application calculates the dose distribution in
  all regions of the geometry specified in the input file and that the
  class derived from EGS_AdvancedApplication implementing this functionality is
  called MyDoseApplication.
  - Re-implement initScoring() to initialize the scoring of quantities of
    interest. In many cases the initialization will simply involve the
    construction of one or more EGS_ScoringArray objects, which will be
    used to accumulate the quantites of interest at run time. It is of course
    possible to have more advanced initialization controlled via a section
    in the input file that can be obtained from the #input protected data
    member (see \em e.g. \c cavity.cpp for an example). For our example case
    of a sode scoring application the implementation could look like this
    \verbatim
    int MyDoseApplication::initScoring() {
        dose = new EGS_ScoringArray(geometry->regions());
        return 0;
    }
    \endverbatim
    Here, \c dose is a class member of type \c EGS_ScoringArray *.
  - Re-implement the startNewShower() function. In most cases the
    implementation will consist of calling the EGS_ScoringArray::setHistory()
    function of all scoring array objects used for accumulating results.
    This is necessary for the history-by-history statistical analysis. In
    our example the implementation should look like this
    \verbatim
    int MyDoseApplication::startNewShower() {
        if( current_case != last_case ) {
            dose->setHistory(current_case);
            last_case = current_case;
        }
        return 0;
    }
    \endverbatim
  - Re-implement the outputData() function to output the current simulation
    results to a data file. This is necessary for the ability to restart a
    simulation or to combine the results of a parallel run. In most cases
    the implementation will involve calling the EGS_AdvancedApplication
    version first, so that data related to the state of the particle source,
    the random number generator, the EGSnrc back-end, etc., is stored, and
    than calling the storeState() function of the scoring objects. In our
    example case the implementation should look like this:
    \verbatim
    int MyDoseApplication::outputData() {
        int err = EGS_AdvancedApplication::outputData();
        if( err ) return err;
        if( !dose->storeState(*data_out) ) return 99;
        return 0;
    }
    \endverbatim
    \em i.e. if an error occurs while storing the base application data
    the function returns this error code. Otherwise it stores the dose data
    and returns a special error code if EGS_ScoringArray::storeState() fails.
  - Re-implement the readData() function to read results from a data file.
    This is necessary for restarted calculations and is basically the
    same as outputData() but now readData() and setState() are used instead
    of outputData() and storeState():
    \verbatim
    int MyDoseApplication::readData() {
        int err = EGS_AdvancedApplication::readData();
        if( err ) return err;
        if( !dose->setState(*data_in) ) return 99;
        return 0;
    }
    \endverbatim
  - Re-implement the resetCounter() function. This function is called before
    combining the results of a parallel run and should set all scoring objects
    to a 'pristine' state. In our example the implementation looks like this:
    \verbatim
    void MyDoseApplication::resetCounter() {
        EGS_AdvancedApplication::resetCounter();
        dose->reset();
    }
    \endverbatim
  - Re-implement the addState() function. This function is called from within
    the loop over parallel job results and should add the data found in the
    data stream passed as argument to the current data. In our example the
    implementation is as follows
    \verbatim
    int MyDoseApplication::addState(istream &data) {
        // **** add base data
        int err = EGS_AdvancedApplication::addState(data);
        if( err ) return err;
        // *** temporary scoring array
        EGS_ScoringArray tmp(geometry->regions());
        if( !tmp.setState(data) ) return 99; // error while reading data
        (*dose) += tmp;                      // add data
        return 0;
    }
    \endverbatim
  - Implement the ausgab() function to perform the actual scoring.
    Unfortunately, this is dependent upon the simulation back-end.
    For an application based on the mortran back-end, the relevant
    data is available from pointers to the Fortran common blocks with
    the general rule that the Fortran common block \c XXX is accessed
    via \c the_xxx, \em e.g. the particle stack is pointed to by
    \c the_stack, the \c EPCONT common that contains information about
    energy deposition, step-lengths, region indeces, etc., via \c the_epcont,
    etc. Information about the various EGSnrc common blocks is found in
    PIRS-701. The common blocks exported as C-style structures are defined
    in \c \$HEN_HOUSE/interface/egs_interface2.h. Depending on the application,
    the ausgab() function may be quite complex. In our example application
    it is very simple:
    \verbatim
    int MyDoseApplication::ausgab(int iarg) {
        if( the_epcont->edep > 0 ) { // energy is being deposited
            int np = the_stack->np - 1; // top particle on the particle stack.
            int ir = the_stack->ir[np]-2; // region index
            if( ir >= 0 ) dose->score(ir,the_epcont->edep*the_stack->wt[np]);
        }
        return 0;
    }
    \endverbatim
    In the above implementation no check is being made for the value of the
    \c iarg argument. This is because by default calls to ausgab() are
    made only for energy deposition events. However, in more advanced
    applciations, one can set up calls to ausgab for a number of other
    events (see PIRS-701, EGS_Application::AusgabCall, setAusgabCall())
    and should check the value of \c iarg to determine the type of
    event initiating the call to ausgab(). Another thing to keep in mind
    is the fact that the Fortran-style indexing is used by the mortran
    back-end so that the top stack particle is
    <code> the_stack->np - 1</code> and not \c the_stack->np. Finally,
    the convention used in the geometry package is that the outside region
    has index -1 while inside regions have indeces from 0 to the number of
    regions - 1. This convention is translated to the outside region being
    region 1 in the mortran back-end and inside regions having indeces 2 to
    number of regions + 1 and makes the subtraction of 2 from the particle
    region index necessary.
  - Re-implement the outputResults() function. The implementation should
    output the results of the simulation in a convenient form. Relatively
    short output could be put into the \c .egslog file by using the
    egsInformation() function for writing the data. Large amounts of data
    are better output into separate output files. To construct an output file
    name the application has access to the base output file name (without
    extension) via getOutputFile(), to the application directory via
    getAppDir(), to the working directory via getWorkDir(), etc.
  - Possibly re-implement the getCurrentResult() function to provide a single
    result and its uncertainty. This is not necessary
    for the proper operation of the application but is a nice feature.
    It is used to obtain a combined result for all parallel jobs during
    parallel processing execution, which is written to the job control
    file. In our example dose application one could for instance provide
    as the single result the dose in a single 'watch region':
    \verbatim
    void MyDoseApplication::getCurrentResult(double &sum, double &sum2,
                                double &norm, double &count) {
        // set number of statistically independent events
        count = current_case;
        // obtain the score in the watch region
        dose->currentScore(watch_region,sum,sum2);
        // set the normalization
        norm = 1.602e-10*count/source->getFluence()/watch_region_mass;
    }
    \endverbatim
    It is worth noting that in the process of combining the results of all
    parallel runs the run control object divides the result by the total
    number of statistically independent events. If we want the normalization
    to be in Gy/incident fluence we have to multiply back by count and
    then divide by the watch region mass, the particle fluence and multiply
    with 1.602e-10 to convert the energy deposited (counted in MeV) to J.
  - Possibly re-implement the describeUserCode() and describeSimulation()
    functions to provide a description of your user code and a description
    of the simulation being performed with both outputs going to the
    log file.

    \todo Add time dependence
