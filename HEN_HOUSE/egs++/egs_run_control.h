/*! \brief A simple run control object for advanced EGSnrc C++ applications.

  \ingroup egspp_main

  In EGSnrc applications derived from EGS_AdvancedApplication the program
  execution is controlled by a 'run control object' (RCO). The purpose of
  the RCO is to tell the shower loop into how many 'chunks' the simulation
  should be split, how many particles to run per simulation chunk, into how
  many batches to split a simulation chunk, etc. In this way it is easy
  for EGSnrc C++ application developers to either use one of the RCO's
  provided with egspp or to implement their own RCO's with alternative
  implementations or strategies for {\em e.g.} parallel job processing.

  <p>Terminology
     - Simulations are split into 'chunks'. For simple simulations
       (no parallel runs, etc.) there is a single simulation chunk
       with the number of histories specified in the input file.
     - Each simulation chunk is split into 'batches'. The batches are
       not required for statistical analysis (by using the provided
       \link EGS_ScoringArray scoring classes \endlink
       it is easy to has a history-by-history uncertainty
       estimation). Instead, simulation chunks are split into batches
       so that the progress of the simulation can be reported after the
       completion of a batch and the current results can be stored into a
       data file. By default there are 10 batches per simulation chunk

  <p>Three RCO's are provided with egspp:
   - A 'simple' RCO implemented in EGS_RunControl. This RCO is used by default
     for single job control. This RCO provides the ability to run simulations
     with a user specified number of particles and up to a user specified
     statistical uncertainty. It also provides the ability to restrict
     the simulation to a user specified maximum CPU time, to perform restarted
     simulations or to simply analyze the results of a previous run or to
     combine the results of previously performed parallel runs.
   - A \link EGS_JCFControl 'job control file' (JCF) RCO \endlink.
     This RCO is used by default for parallel runs. It has all the functionality
     of the 'simple' RCO plus additional methods to control parallel execution
     via a 'job control file'.
   - A \link EGS_UniformRunControl uniform RCO \endlink.
     This RCO distributes the histories uniformly among all jobs.
     It can be an alternative to the JCF RCO when a JCF cannot be used. This can
     happen when jobs do not start sequentially. In such cases the JCF may not be
     available if job number 1 is not started first.

/*! \brief A job control object for homogeneous computing environments (HCE).

   \ingroup egspp_main

   The uniform RCO is used for controlling parallel job execution
   in computing environments (CE) with identical hardware, software
   and communication layer (aka homogeneous CE):

   - Number of histories 'ncase' split equally among all jobs.

   - Assume last job finishes last and then cycles 5 times by default
     ('check_intervals' variable) for a period of time defined to
     be 1 s by default ('milliseconds' variable). Defaults can be changed
     via the 'run control' input block using:

       interval wait time  = time in ms (default 1 s)
       number of intervals = an_integer_value (default 5)

   - The last job combines the parallel runs by default. Since the last job
     could finish before some of the other jobs, users can set another
     job or several jobs to be 'watcher' jobs. In principle it is enough to
     define one 'watcher' job that waits long enough for all jobs to complete.
     To change the default, use the following key:

     watcher jobs = job_i,..., job_j

   - If requested, a run-completion check can be made every cycle
     by checking that the number of *.egsdat files equals the number
     of parallel jobs submitted. This could speed things up by not having
     to wait for all checking cycles. However, it could also be the case
     that some jobs might have failed, in which case, after the checking
     cycles complete, only the available *.egsdat files will be combined.

     This option can be set via the 'run control' input block using:

     check jobs completed = yes|no # default is 'no'

     When this option is enabled, each job erases at the beginning of the run
     its corresponding *.egsdat file if it exists.
