/*! \brief A phase space scoring object: header

\ingroup AusgabObjects

This ausgab object generates phase space data for particles using one of two methods:
1. Scores particles exiting and/or entering all surfaces of a predefined geometry.
   The geometry can be a component of the simulation geometry or coincident with a surface
   in the simulation geometry.
2. Scores particles on exiting one user-specified region and entering another.
   The user can specify multiple exit/entry region pairs.

Phase space data can be scored in one of 2 possible formats:

EGSnrc format: E,x,y,u,v,wt,latch
IAEA format: iq,E,[x],[y],[z],u,v,wt,latch,[mu]

Note that in IAEA format, the user has the option of specifying a fixed x, y, and/or z coordinate
of the scoring plane/line/point, in which case the fixed coordinates shall not be scored for each
particle but will be specified in the header (.IAEAheader) file.  Also, in this format, the
user has the option of scoring the synchronization parameter, mu, passed from the source.

Can be used in any C++ user code by entering the proper input block in
the ausgab object definition block.

:start ausgab object definition:
      :start ausgab object:
          library                  = egs_phsp_scoring
          name                     = some_name
          output format            = EGSnrc or IAEA
          constant X               = X value (cm) at which all particles are scored (IAEA format only)
          constant Y               = Y value (cm) at which all particles are scored (IAEA format only)
          constant Z               = Z value (cm) at which all particles are scored (IAEA format only)
          particle type            = all, photons, or charged
          score mu                 = yes or no [default] (IAEA format only)
          score multiple crossers  = no (default) or yes (EGSnrc format only)
          output directory         = name of output directory

     and one of two methods of scoring particles:

     Method 1: score particles on entry to/exit from a predefined geometry
          phase space geometry     = name of previously defined geometry
          score particles on       = entry, exit, entry and exit [default]

     Method 2: score particles on exiting one region and entering another
          from regions             = list of exit region numbers
          to regions               = list of entry region numbers

      :stop ausgab object:
:stop ausgab object definition:

Phase space data is output to the file some_name.egsphsp1 (EGSnrc format)
or some_name.1.IAEAphsp and some_name.1.IAEAheader (IAEA format)
Note that if the user specifies constant X/Y/Z, then particles are all assumed to be scored at the
same X/Y/Z with this(ese) values output to .IAEAheader instead of being output for each particle
to the .IAEAphsp file.

Particles of the type indicated by the "particle type" input are scored.  If this input
is omitted, then all particles are scored.

In IAEA-format phase space files, the user can opt to score the synchronization parameter, mu.
This option will automatically be turned off if the parameter is not available from the
source.  Currently, this parameter can only be passed from egs_beam_source (only if the accelerator
includes synchronized CMs), iaea_phsp_source (if scored using a BEAMnrc simulation with
synchronized CMs or scored using this ausgab object with mu scoring turned on) and
egs_dynamic_source (always available).

The default is to not score multiple crossers (and their descendents) and, indeed, this
is, by definition, the protocol for IAEA format phase space files.  However, if the user is scoring
data in EGSnrc format, then they have the option to include multiple crossers and their
descendents.  Note that the marker for a particle having been scored is to set bit 31 of the
particle's latch high.  Thus, the marker is associated with the particle, not the scoring
object.  This has implications if the user wishes to have multiple phase space scoring
objects in one run: a particle scored by one phase space scoring object will not subsequently
be scored by another, unless the user has set "score multiple crossers = yes" in the
latter.

If "output directory" is omitted or left blank then the output directory defaults to the
application directory (i.e. $EGS_HOME/appname).

When using a phase space scoring geometry, particles can be scored on entering the phase space geometry,
exiting the geometry, or both (the default).  Be aware of how the "inside" and "outside" of the geometry
are defined when using this option.

When using pairs of exit/entry regions, the number of regions specified by the "to regions" input
must equal that of the "from regions" input.  If the exit region number is equal to the entry
region number, then the pair is deleted prior to the run.

A note on parallel runs:
If a phase space file is being written during a parallel run, then each job, i, outputs its phase
space data to some_name_wi.[egsphsp1][.1.IAEAheader/phsp]. Thus, the naming scheme is the same as
that for other output files from a parallel run.  These phase space files are not added automatically
when the results of a parallel run are combined.  The user must either use the addphsp tool or
program their own concatenation routine.

Example:
The following example input illustrates the two phase space scoring methods.  In both
cases, phase space is scored in planes perpendicular to the axis of a water/air cylinder.

The first ausgab object, "test," uses scoring method 2 (exit/entry region pairs) to
score phase space data, in IAEA format, for all particles crossing a plane perpendicular
to the cylinder and at the mid-point of the cylinder (Z=10 cm).  Data will be scored
for particles within the innermost cylinder (exit/entry regions 0/3) and within the outermost
annulus (exit/entry regions 2/5).  Note that the constant Z value of the scoring plane is input,
so data will be in 2D format.  Also note that IAEA format, by convention, does not score multiple
crossers.  The output will be to test.1.IAEAheader (header file) and test.1.IAEAphsp (phase space data).

The second ausgab object, "test2," uses scoring method 1 (predefined scoring geometry) to
score phase space data, in EGSnrc format, for all particles crossing a single plane coincident with
the bottom (Z=21 cm) of the cylinder.  The scoring plane is given by the geometry, "scoreplane,"
which defines a single plane perpendicular to Z at Z=21 cm.  Recall that a single plane defines
a single region on the +ve normal side of the plane.  In this example, a particle is considered "outside"
scoreplane if Z < 21.0 and inside if Z > 21.0 and, thus, scoring particles on "entry" will collect
data for all particles leaving out the bottom of the cylinder.  In this case, however, the specification
of scoring direction is moot, since particles leaving the bottom of the cylinder are effectively leaving
the simulation geometry.  Note that the option to score multiple crossers has been turned on.  Otherwise,
particles previously scored in "test" would not be scored by "test2."  Phase space data will be output
to test2.egsphsp1.
