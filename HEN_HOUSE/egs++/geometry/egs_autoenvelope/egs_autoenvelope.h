\ingroup Geometry
\ingroup CompositeG

EGS_AEnvelope is a fast envelope geometry used to inscribe one or more
copies of another geometry inside of a base geometry (for example a
brachytherapy seed inside a rectilinear phantom).

The implementation is very similar to the (currently undocumented)
EGS_FastEnvelope geometry (and indeed the implementation borrows heavily
from that class). Both of these geometry classes gain an efficiency
advantage over regular EGS_EnvelopeGeometry geometries by skipping the
boundary checks of inscribed geometries when the particle is in a region of
the base geometry without any other geometries inscribed in it.

With the EGS_FastEnvelope a user must manually specify which inscribed
geometries are present in a given region of the base geometry.  This process
would be tedious and error prone for base geometries with large numbers of
regions and many inscribed geometries in arbitrary orientations.  Instead of
this manual process, the Auto Envelope uses a Monte Carlo simulation to
determine which regions of the base geometry contain inscribed geometries.
This Monte Carlo process can also optionally be used to correct voxel volumes
of the base geometry.


As an example, consider a 5.1cm x 5.1cm x 5.1cm EGS_XYZGeometry phantom
subdivided into 0.2cm x 0.2cm x 0.2cm voxels (51^3=132 651 voxels), with 125
brachytherapy seeds inscribed in it.  With a regular EGS_EnvelopeGeometry,
the howfar routine has to check the boundaries of 126 geometry objects (1
base geometry + 125 seeds) at each step of the simulation.   With a fast
envelope, if a particle is in a voxel without any inscribed geometries
present the howfar routine only needs to check the boundaries of the base
phantom geometry and can skip the checks for the other 125 seed geometries.
This can make simulations with a fast envelope run an order of magnitude
faster than the same simulation using a plain EGS_EnvelopeGeometry.


Region Discovery / Volume Correction Algorithm
--------------------------------------------

(Note: Currently the auto envelope can only accomodate a single type of inscribed
geometry, although it could be adapted to handle an aribtrary number of
different inscribed geometries.)

With reference to the diagram below you can show that
if the bounding shape volume is \f$V_{BS}\f$, then the
inscribed geometry  volume, \f$V_{inscribed}\f$, is estimated as:

\f[

 V_{inscribed} =(total\_in\_inscribed / n\_total\_points) * V_{BS}

\f]

and the volume of the shape inside a give region \f$i\f$, \f$V_{inscribed}(i)\f$ is given by:

\f[
 V_{inscribed}(i) = (n\_inscribed(i)/n\_total\_points) * V_{BS}
\f]

So the corrected volume of region \f$i\f$ is just:

\f[
 V_{corrected}(i) = V_{uncorrected}(i) - (n\_inscribed(i)/n\_total\_points) * V_{BS}
\f]


\image html vc_diagram800.png "Volume correction diagram"


The way the algorithm works is roughly:

- Choose a random point in space within the bounding shape.
- Check whether the point lands within the inscribed geometry
- If the point is outside, stop and go to step 1
- If the point is inside increment total number of points falling within
  inscribe geometry
- Transform the point to all locations of the inscribed geometry
- find the region of the base geometry that the point falls within
- increment the number of hits in that region
- add the inscribed geometry to the set of all geometries in that region

which in pseudo-code would look something like:
\verbatim

total_in_inscribed = 0

for i = 1 to n_base_regions
    n_inscribed[i] =  0
    geoms_in_reg[i] = empty_set()

for step = 1 to n_total_points

    point  =  get_random_point_within_bounding_shape()

    if inscribed_geom.point_is_inside(point):

        total_in_inscribed += 1

        for inscribed_copy in all_inscribed_copies:
            transformed_point = transform_point_to_location(inscribed_copy.location, point)
            base_geom_reg =  base_geom.whichRegion(transformed_point)
            n_inscribed[base_geom_reg] += 1
            geoms_in_reg[base_geom_reg].add_to_set(inscribed_copy)


\endverbatim

Geometry Definition Format
--------------------------

There is an example geometry included in the examples/seeds_in_xyz_aenv.geom file.

\verbatim

:start geometry:

    library = egs_autoenvelope
    name = autoenvelope
    type = EGS_AEnvelope # optional: EGS_AEnvelope(default) or EGS_ASwitchedEnvelope
    print debug info = no  # optional: no(default), yes
    output volume correction file = gzip # optional no(default), yes(equivalent to text), text or gzip

    base geometry = name_of_base_geom # the name of a previously defined geometry

    :start inscribed geometry:

        inscribed geometry name = seed # the name of a previously defined geometry

        # optional: locations of inscribed geometries.  If no transformations
        # are included, a single inscribed geometry at the origin will be used
        :start transformations:
            :start transformation:
                translation = -2,-2,-2
            :stop transformation:

            :start transformation:
                translation = -2,-2,-1
            :stop transformation:

        :stop transformations:

        :start region discovery:

            action = discover # optional: discover (default), discover and correct volume, discover and zero volume

            volume correction file = phantom.autoenv.volcor # optional (if using omit below)

            density of random points (cm^-3) = 1E7 # optional random point sampling density defaults to 1E8

            # bounding shape definition. Note only volumetric shapes make sense here!
            :start shape:

                type = cylinder
                radius = 0.04
                height = 0.45

            :stop shape:

            # optional rng definition
            :start rng definition:
                type = sobol
                initial seed = 1234
            :stop rng definition:

            # -or-

            :start rng definition:
                type = ranmar
                initial seeds = 123, 456
            :stop rng definition:


        :stop region discovery:

    :stop inscribed geometry:

:stop geometry:

\endverbatim

Volume correction files
-----------------------

By including the `output volume correction file = text # text or gzip`
input key, you can output a volume correction file that will output a file
which includes all of the regions that were found to contain inscribed
geometries and their corrected volumes. (For the gzip functionality you
must have the egspp-geometry-lib-extras installed: see Optional Features
below).

The volume correction file can then be used in future runs by using a
volume correction block like the following for the inscribed geometry:

\verbatim

   :start region discovery:
       action = discover # optional: discover(default), discover and correct volume, discover and zero volume
       volume correction file = phantom.autoenv.volcor
   :stop region discovery:

\endverbatim

This allows you to e.g. run a lengthy volume correction a single time and
then reuse the volume correction file in future runs.

Points to consider
------------------

For performance reasons, the bounding shape should be made to just cover the
inscribed geometry (this minimizes the total number of random points used).

Due to the nature of region discovery algorithm, it is possible that not all
regions containing inscribed geometries will be discovered.  This would
generally happen if your bounding shape is too small to cover the entire
insribed geometry or you choose a density of points that is too low.

By default a Sobol quasi-random number generator (if available, see
    `Optional Features` below) is used for volume correction/region
discovery but that can be overridden by including an `rng definition`
block (see example input above)


EGS_ASwitchedEnvelope
------------------

There is a second geometry, a "switched" Auto Envelope type included in the
auto envelope library.  This geometry type allows you to activate and
deactivate inscribed geometries in custom egspp user codes.  As an example,
this geometry was developed to allow for investigating how interseed
attenuation affects dose distributions in brachytherapy implants.  By only
having one seed active at a time, you can simulate a superposition (TG43
style) type calculation.

The inputs are all exactly the same as the EGS_AEnvelope and only the
first inscribed geometry is activated upon initialization. Examples of using
this geometry type are available in the EGS_ASwitchedEnvelope class documentation.

Examples
--------

An example geometry file using an autoenvelope is provided in
seeds_in_xyz_aenv.geom.


Optional Features
-----------------

In order to use the gzip and Sobol functionality you must have the egspp-geometry-lib-extras
installed.  Due to NRC licensing requirements this code is distributed separately and
can be obtained from https://github.com/clrp-code/egspp-geometry-lib-extras/ .
