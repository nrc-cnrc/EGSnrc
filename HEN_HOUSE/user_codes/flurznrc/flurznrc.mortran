"   Instructons for use of input routines
"
"   Input is via the routine get_inputs which has extensive documentation
"   at the top of its source code.
"
"   Inputs are all in the format: name of value_sought= value
"   where the name of value_sought must match that expected by the
"   program. The = sign must have no blanks on its immediate left and
"   at least one on its immediate right..
"
"   The value_sought must be the first thing on a line but blanks are
"     allowed before it.
"
"   Various inputs are only sought between certain delimeter strings
"     which are defined below (eg :start I/O control: :stop I/O control:)
"     If not specified, the whole file is searched for a requested value_sought.
"     Delimeter strings are enclosed by colons.
"     Note that within delimeter strings, order of inputs does not matter.
"
"   If a requested quantity is not found, this is noted in $input.errors
"     and this file is printed at the end of the log file.
"
"   A semi-colon implies the end of input for this quantity but is
"     not mandatory.  However, this means they cannot be used in titles.
"   A # sign indicated everything else on the line is a comment (and
"     cannot be used in titles.
"   Case is not important in the names of the quantites.
"
"   Commas separate multiple values for a given quantity and a comma
"     at the end of a line implies there is more input on the next line.
"   Values can extend over as many lines as needed. Use commas to imply
"     there are more values on the next line.
"
"   Blank lines and blanks in general are ignored.
"   tabs are NOT allowed when character input is being sought,
"   including tabs used to put # to the right after a character input. Use
"   blanks instead.
"
"   The maximum record length is 256 characters.
"
"   There is a routine morph_flurz which takes an old format input file
"     and translates it.
"
"   There should be a file morph_template.egs4inp which can be used
"     and which defines most options.
"
"   One drawback of this system is that there is a disconnect between
"     the internal variable name used and the value_sought strings.
"     In the input description variables listed in [ ] braces are
"     the internal variable names associated with this input.
