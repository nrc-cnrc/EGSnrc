"                      going on to the next particle.
"                      If NRCYCL is set <=0 then NRCYCL is automatically

"                      no. of electrons), NSMISS is the no. of particles that

"                      the value of NRCYCL used in the previous run,

"                      were beyond BEAM_SIZE in the previous run, NRJCT
"                      is the no. of particles rejected because they were

"                      space files). All of the aforementioned values are

"
"   Note: the following 2 inputs are only relevant if you are manually
"         creating/submitting your parallel jobs or if you are using the
"         unix pprocess script.  In the case of the pprocess script, these
"         inputs get set automatically.
"
"          IPARALLEL   set >1 if you are distributing the job among IPARALLEL
"                      machines.  This will generate
"                      a binary .pardose file for each job which will contain
"                      the doses in all voxels WITHOUT UNCERTAINTIES.  IPARALLEL
"                      defaults to 0.
"            PARNUM    Only needs to be set if IPARALLEL>1 and you are using
"                      a single phase space source.  The partition of the phase
"                      space source that will be used for this one of the
"                      series of parallel input files (for the same total
"                      simulation) is given by:
"                       (PARNUM-1)*(nshist/IPARALLEL)<nnphsp<=
"                                                (PARNUM)*(nshist/IPARALLEL)
"                      where nshist is the total number of particles in the
"                      phase space file and nnphsp is the number of the
"                      particle chosen for the simulation.  Thus, PARNUM
"                      should cover the range 1<=PARNUM<=IPARALLEL.  If you
"                      are using a separate phase space source for each
"                      parallel job (ie the phase space source exists in
"                      IPARALLEL pieces) and, thus, do not wish to partition
"                      the phase space sources, PARNUM can be left at its
"                      default value of 0.
"
"            n_split   If set > 1, then all photons will be split
"                      n_split times.  This option increases the efficiency of
"                      dose caluclations more than photon forcing.
"                      A rule of thumb for good efficiency is
"                         n_split >= No/(1-exp(-Lambda))
"                      where Lambda is the approx. number of photon MFP
"                      in the geometry of interest and No >= 5.
"                      Note that if you use the above, there will
"                      be on average approx. No primary interactions per
"                      incident photon => reduce the number of
"                      histories by this number.
"
"        The n_split algorithm works as follows:
"         * dpmfp_i = -log(1 - (eta+i)/n_split)
"           where dpmfp_i is MFP to the next interaction for the i-th sub-photon
"           eta is a random number (the same for all n_split sub-photons)
"         * Once at the interaction site, the i'th sub-photon produces
"           electrons and/or scattered photons. Scattered photons are
"           killed with probability 1/n_split, so that, if they survive,
"           they have the weight of the original photon. Electrons have the
"           weight of 1/n_split of original weight.
"         * In any radiative events (brems, annih, annih at rest), photons
"           are killed with probability 1/n_split => they have again the
"           weight of the photon that initiated the history, if they survive
"
"        ihowfarless   Set to 1 to use the 'HOWFARLESS' algorithm for
"                      transport in a homogeneous phantom.  When 'HOWFARLESS'
"                      is used, subroutines HOWFAR and HOWNEAR only consider
"                      the extreme outer boundaries of the phantom when
"                      calculating the distance along the particle trajectory
"                      or nearest perpendicular distance to a region boundary.
"                      This removes the restriction that charged particle
"                      steps must stop at all voxel boundaries and, thus,
"                      speeds up the calculation considerably.  For the purpose
"                      of dose deposition in the voxels, the total curved
"                      charged particle step is approximated using 2 straight-
"                      line steps joined at a hinge point.  See the DOSXYZnrc
"                      manual for more details about the approximation.
"                      Restrictions on charged particle step length then become
"                      the EGSnrc input variables Smax (max. allowable charged
"                      particle step length) and estepe (max. fractional energy
"                      loss/step).  Leaving Smax set to its default value
"                      of 5 cm should maximize efficiency of the 'HOWFARLESS'
"                      algorithm at most beam energies.  Efficiency improvement
"                      due to 'HOWFARLESS' depends on the incident beam type,
"                      DOSXYZnrc voxel size and the boundary crossing algorithm
"                      (BCA) used.  For incident photon beams from accelerators
"                      simulated with BEAMnrc (phase space or BEAMnrc sim.
"                      sources), the efficiency improves by ~30%
"                      when the PRESTA-I BCA is used, and by factors of
"                      2.5-3.5 when the more accurate (but slower) EXACT
"                      BCA is used.  In monoenergetic electron beams,
"                      'HOWFARLESS' improves efficiency by a factor of up to
"                      ~4 with the PRESTA-I BCA and by a factor of up to
"                      ~15 with the EXACT BCA.  Recommended for all homogeneous

" Range rejection macro:

" DOSXYZnrc bypasses the EGSnrc built-in range rejection (implemented in
" the $RANGE-DISCARD macro in EGSnrc) because EGSnrc range rejection
" uses particle range to AE, while we want to use particle range to
" ECUTIN.  In the macro below, DNEAR(NP) is the perpendicular distance from
" the particle to the nearest region boundary, range is the particle range to
" AE (calculated in EGSnrc) and RANGE_ECUTRR(MED(IRL)) is the range from ECUTIN
" to AE in the medium in region IRL (calculated at the beginning of the
" simulation).  Thus, range-RANGE_ECUTRR(MED(IRL)) is the particle range to
" ECUTIN in region IRL, scaled for non-default density, and if
" DNEAR is >= this, we can discard the particle.
"
" No range rejection is done in vacuum, if IREJECT=0, or if the particle energy

subroutine howfar;

"   howfar routine to use with a generalized cartesian coordinate system
"
"   Routine is optimized for speed - please suggest improvements
"
"   Geometrical information is passed in COMIN/GEOM,SOURCE/
"
"   xbound($IMAX),ybound($JMAX),zbound($KMAX),IMAX,JMAX,KMAX,ijmax,irmax
"   xbound etc are the x, y and z boundaries defining the voxels
"   $IMAX etc are the maximum number of elements in each direction
"       as defined in the users main program
"   IMAX etc are the actual number of elements in each direction for
"       this particular calculation
"   ijmax = IMAX*JMAX   a useful number
"   irmax = 1 + ijmax*ikmax   the total number of regions in the
"       current problem
"   region 1 is the exterior region and signifies particle left geometry
"   region irmax+1 is the surrounding air region if it exists.
"
"     Each voxel is defined by a triple of integers (i,j,k) (but called
"           irx,iry and irz in this routine) such that:
"
"           xbound(i) <= x < xbound(i+1)     1 < i < IMAX
"           ybound(j) <= y < ybound(j+1)     1 < j < JMAX
"           zbound(k) <= z < zbound(k+1)     1 < k < KMAX
"
"  The x axis is to the right, y axis down the page and z into the page
"
"  The region number is defined as:
"       ir = 1 + i + (j-1)*IMAX + (k-1)*ijmax
"
"  The routine sets dnear. Note that in problems where the typical
"  step size is of the order of the region dimensions, then computing
"  dnear can decrease efficiency. In this case the two lines containing
"  dnear should be commented out
"
"  The routine assumes $DECODEIR(irl,i,j,k) is expanded to calculate
"      i,j,k given irl, the current region
"
"  Equivalence statements are used to allow variable names to be used
"           in the main macro for each direction
