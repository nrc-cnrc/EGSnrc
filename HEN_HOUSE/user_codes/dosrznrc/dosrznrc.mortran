"       INTRODUCTION:
"       This code simulates the passage of an electron or photon beam in a
"       finite, right cylindrical  geometry.
"
"       It also scores pulse height distributions
"       in an arbitrary volume made up of any number of regions.
"       There is a write to unit 2 of the calculated spectra/response functions
"
"       The energy deposited within various user defined regions is scored and
"       analyzed statistically following the simulation.
;
"       USER CONTROLS:
"       The user 1) defines the geometry of the target via the input of a
"                   number of planar and cylindrical coordinates which
"                   divide the cylinder into a number of regions, each region
"                   composed of a user specified material.
"                2) specifies in which of these regions the dose is to be
"                   scored.
"                3) selects the form and degree of detail of the output.
"                4) selects either the energy if a monoenergetic beam is to be
"                   used or specifies an energy spectrum consisting of
"                   energy points and corresponding probabibities
"                5) selects the source of radiation from amongst parallel and
"                   point sources originating from the side or front,
"                   isotropically radiating sources embedded in regions
"                   in the cylinder and phase space files from BEAM.
"                6) selects the number of histories, time limit and statistical
"                   limit. all histories will be run unless time runs out or
"                   the variance calculated in the peak region drops below
"                   the statistical limit.
"                7) selects transport controls such as the fractional energy
"                   loss per charged particle step, the maximum step size,
"                   particle energy cutoffs, range rejection parameters.
"
"       SIMULATION:
"       Each particle emitted from the source is transported along with all its
"       offspring (with energies greater than the cutoff) using EGS4.
"
"       SCORING:
"       In each of the defined dose scoring regions, the total dose and the
"       dose less that due to stopped/discarded particles is scored. In
"       addition, the dose scored in a region can be broken down into that
"       due to particles which entered via the front wall, back wall, outer
"       wall and inner wall. The total number of charged particle steps
"       taken and the total number taken in the dose scoring region
"       are counted.
"
"       OUTPUT:
"       The first section of the output echos the user input.
"       The second section is is composed of messages and information printed
"       during the simulation as a means of monitoring the simulation.
"       The third section details the total doses accumulated with
"       accompanying statistical uncertainties.
"       The first and third sections may include grid format summaries if
"       requested by the user.
"       Plot files for the xmgr program are also output.

"                       HISTORY
"
"   This is the work-horse dose scoring code developed and used extensively
"   at NRC.  The major developers were Alex Bielajew and Dave Rogers
"   and undergarduate student assistants along with specific patches
"   and extensions by others at NRC. In particular, it was converted
"   for EGSnrc use by Iwan Kawrakow.

"*******************************************************************************
"*******************************************************************************
"   Instructons for use of input routines
"
"   Input is via the routine get_inputs which has extensive documentation
"   at the top of its source code.
"
"   Inputs are all in the format: name of value_sought= value
"   where the name of value_sought must match that expected by the
"   program. The = sign must have no blanks on its immediate left and
"   at least one on its immediate right..
"
"   The value_sought must be the first thing on a line but blanks are
"     allowed before it.
"
"   Various inputs are only sought between certain delimeter strings
"     which are defined below (eg :start I/O control: :stop I/O control:)
"     If not specified, the whole file is searched for a requested value_sought.
"     Delimeter strings are enclosed by colons.
"     Note that within delimeter strings, order of inputs does not matter.
"
"   If a requested quantity is not found, this is noted in $input.errors
"     and this file is printed at the end of the log file.
"
"   A semi-colon implies the end of input for this quantity but is
"     not mandatory.  However, this means they cannot be used in titles.
"   A # sign indicated everything else on the line is a comment (and
"     cannot be used in titles.
"   Case is not important in the names of the quantites.
"
"   Commas separate multiple values for a given quantity and a comma
"     at the end of a line implies there is more input on the next line.
"   Values can extend over as many lines as needed. Use commas to imply
"     there are more values on the next line.
"
"   Blank lines and blanks in general are ignored.
"   tabs are NOT allowed when character input is being sought,
"   including tabs used to put # to the right after a character input. Use
"   blanks instead.
"
"   The maximum record length is 256 characters.
"
"   There is a routine morph_dosrz which takes an old format input file
"     and translates it.
"
"   There should be a file morph_template.egs4inp which can be used
"     and which defines most options.
"
"   One drawback of this system is that there is a disconnect between
"     the internal variable name used and the value_sought strings.
"     In the input description variables listed in [ ] braces are
"     the internal variable names associated with this input.

"     AN AUSGAB ROUTINE TO BE USED WITH DOSRZnrc.mortran
"
"     Called with IARG = -1 after each history is over in order to
"     score things for the pulse height distribution when IFULL = 2.
"
"     For IFULL = 2 (passed in COMIN SCORE), the parameter phener keeps
"     track of the energy deposited in the sensitive volume defined by non-
"     zero elements in the array IPHR($MXREG) (passed IN SCORE).
"
"     This routine scores the dose in a finite, azimuthally symmetric
"     cylindrical geometry which the user defines via plane and radial
"     coordinates. The user must specify both the target geometry as well
"     as the planes and radii between which the dose is to be scored. All
"     the geometrical checks for crossing 'geometrical' or 'dose' regions
"     are handled by the subroutine  HOWFAR.
;
"     FOR IT = 1      total dose is scored
"            = 2      dose less stopped/discarded particles is scored
"                     For IFULL = 3 the scattered dose for incident photons
"            = 3      dose due to particles entering the dose region from
"                     the front wall
"            = 4      dose due to particles entering the dose region from
"                     the side wall
"            = 5      dose due to particles entering the dose region from
"                     the back wall
"            = 6      dose due to particles entering the dose region from
"                     the inside wall
"            = 7      dose due to particles originates from within an
"                     isotropically radiating disk buried in the geometry
"                     which have not yet strayed outside the source region
"
"     Some of the logic
"             Bit 6 of latch is set for all photons scattered after Compton
"             Bit 7 of LATCH is set for all photons after photoeffect
"             Bit 8 of LATCH is no longer set. Not clear what it was for

"       For particle NP on the STACK in region IR(NP), this routine

"       the boundry and IRNEW is set to the zone number on the far side of
"       the boundary. If IR(NP) is 1 then the particle has escaped the region
"       of interest and the history is terminated.(IDISC is set to 1.)
