#  Example input file for EDKnrc: 1 MeV photon interacting at origin. PEGS4
#  data set used is 521icru.pegs4dat supplied with EGSnrc.
#
#  BEWARE: the high cut-off energies in 521icru.pegs4dat are NOT suited for
#  low energy calculations, where 1 keV cut-off is required. Users need to
#  create a PEGS4 data sets with lower cut-off energies in that case.

# Atomic relaxations, Rayleigh scattering, Photoelectron angular sampling and
# Bound compton scattering can be turned on/off on a region by region basis.
# Instead of simply "On" or "Off" for these cases put:
#    Atomic relaxations= On (or Off) in Regions
#    Relaxations start region= 1, 40   #turns relaxations on in regions 1-10 and
#    Relaxations stop region=  10, 99  #40-99
#
#    Rayleigh scattering= On (or Off) in Regions
#    Rayleigh start region= 1, 40
#    Rayleigh stop region= 10, 99
#
#    Photoelectron angular sampling= On (or Off) in Regions
#    PE sampling start region= 1, 40
#    PE sampling stop region= 10, 99
#
#    Bound Compton scattering= On (or Off) in Regions
#    Bound Compton start region= 1, 40
#    Bound Compton stop region= 10, 99

#ECUT, PCUT and SMAX can also be set on a region-by-region basis.
#
#Set XXXX=              f_value1, f_value2, ...
#Set XXXX start region= i_value1, i_value2, ...
#Set XXXX stop region=  j_value1, j_value2, ...
#
#where XXXX is ECUT, PCUT or SMAX ,
#f_value1, f_value2,... are the desired values for XXXX
#and i_value_i and j_value_i are the start and
#stop regions.
Set PCUT= 0
Set PCUT start region= 1
Set PCUT stop region= 1
Set ECUT=             0
Set ECUT start region=  1
Set ECUT stop region= 1
