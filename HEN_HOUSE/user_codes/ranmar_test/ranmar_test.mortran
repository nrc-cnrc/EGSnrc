"Note, this is a test routine for the EGS rng ranmar.  The RNG is a machine
"independent RNG and thus this code tests that the sum of the
"first 10, 10,000,  100,000 and 1,000,000 calls is correct
"
"To use this test:
"create a standard egs usercode subdirectory called ranmar_test
"
"copy ranmar_test.mortran and ranmar_test.configuration to this area
"
"Compile the code as mf ranmar_test a opt?
"Execute as ex ranmar_test ' ' 700icru
"                        any data set will do, not used

"This code produces identical results for NRC's
"SunOS sparcs (opt0,2), SGI's(opt 0,2,3), Linux opt 0,
"DEC ALPHA/OSF (opt 0 or 4)

"Note that optimizers are known to mess things up on occasion
"Specifically the default RANDOMSET shown below fails on
"SGI opt level 3 unless an extra IF(fool_optimizer... stmt is added
"which forces the optimizer not to optimize
"However, if the fool_optimizer stmt is removed in this code, it works
"OK in this simple case!!  i.e. this is not the `final word''

"If you are running on a non SGI system, you should remove
"the extra IF(fool_optimizer  statement from the definition of
"RANDOMSET since this is an extra test for no reason

"So far we have also found that the initialization routine
"also fails on the Linux g77.05.020 compiler, opt2
"and this can be fixed by ading various IF(fool_optimizer...
"statements in subroutine rmarin
