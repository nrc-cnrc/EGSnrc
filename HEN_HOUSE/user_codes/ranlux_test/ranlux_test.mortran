"Note, this is a test routine for the EGSnrc rng.  The RNG is a machine
"independent RNG and thus this code tests that the sum of the
"first 10, 10,000,  100,000 and 1,000,000 calls is correct
"
"To use this test:
"create a standard egs usercode subdirectory called ranlux_test
"
"copy ranlux_test.mortran and ranlux_test.configuration to that area
"
"Compile the code as mf ranlux_test a opt?
"
"Execute as ex ranlux_test ' ' 700icru
"                        any data set will do, since it is not used

"This code produces identical results for NRC's various machines"
"     Have tested SGI R4400, Linux g77"
