"       INTRODUCTION:
"       THIS CODE SIMULATES THE PASSAGE OF AN ELECTRON OR PHOTON BEAM IN A
"       FINITE, SHPERICAL-CONICAL GEOMETRY.
"       IT IS INTENDED FOR USE IN CALCULATING QUANTITIES OF INTEREST FOR
"       THICK-WALLED ION CHAMBERS EXPOSED TO PHOTON BEAMS ALTHOUGH IT MAY
"       BE USED SIMPLY TO SCORE DOSE IN A SPHERICAL-CONICAL GEOMETRY. IN
"       ADDITION TO SCORING DOSE, THE FOLLOWING QUANTITIES MAY ALSO BE
"       SCORED:
"
"          1)THE Aatt  CORRECTION FACTOR    (attenuation of primary beam),
"          2)THE Ascat CORRECTION FACTOR    (photon scatter),
"          3)THE Apn   CORRECTION FACTOR    (for point-source beams, obtained
"                                             by correlated sampling),
"          4)THE Afl   CORRECTION FACTOR    (obtained by correlated sampling),
"          5)<s>g,w STOPPING POWER RATIO    (obtained by correlated sampling)
"
"       FOR A DERIVATION OF THE ABOVE FACTORS, CONSULT
"       `Correction factors for thick-walled ionisation chambers in
"        point source photon beams' by AF Bielajew PMB 35(1990)501-516.

"******************************************************************************
"
"       ADAPTED FROM AN EARLIER VERSION OF CAVSPHnrc AND INTRODUCING MANY OF
"       THE CURRENT IMPROVEMENTS IN CAVRZnrc.
"
"       - only IFULL=0 and 1 are currently available,i.e.,only Dgas, Dgas/Awall,
"         Ascat, Aatt and Awall are currently calculated.
"
"       - Scoring is performed on a hist/hist basis parallel to the usual batch
"         scoring mode.
"
"       - Although most ion chambers are modeled with pure spherical geometries,
"         one could use this code to just score the dose in a spherical-conical
"         geometry.
"
"       - Sources available : parallel (0) and point source (1) from any angle.
"         One can also select ISOURC=4 to have photons starting at origin moving
"         along the z-axis and forcing the first interaction, but it hasn't been
"         tested here. A code for point spread function calculations is also
"         available: PSFnrc.mortran

"  All input associated with selection of various transport parameter
"  is not crucial for the execution as there are default values set.
"  Therefore, if some of the input options in this section are
"  missing/misspelled, this will be ignored and default parameters assumed
"  As the transport parameter input routine uses get_inputs, a lot
"  of error/warning messages may be produced on UNIT 15, though.
"  If you don't have the intention of changing default settings,
"  simply ignore the error messages.

"       Atomic relaxations, Rayleigh scattering,

"                         can also be turned On/Off on a region-by-region
"                         basis. To do so, put e.g.
"
"       Atomic relaxations= On in Regions   or
"       Atomic relaxations= Off in regions
"
"                         in your input file. Then use

"        Relaxations start region=  1, 40
"        Relaxations stop region=  10, 99
"                         will first turn off relaxations everywhere and
"                         then turn off in regions 1-10 and 40-99.

" The following common is for an alternative calculation of   "
" D/Awall and D using cross section enhancement. If turned on "
" (by setting cs_enhance > 1), the photon cross section is    "
" multiplied with cs_enhance (this is accomplished via a      "
" modifcation of the $RAYLEIGH-CORRECTION nacro, see below).  "
" When an interaction occurs, the "
" electrons set in motion are given the weight 1/cs_enhance.  "
" The scattered photons are killed with probability           "
" 1/cs_enhance. If they survive, their latch variable is set  "
" to 3 so that they contribute only to the calculation of the "
" real dose. The original photons get their latch set to 1 or "
" 2 with the probability 1/cs_enhance and 1-1/cs_enhance, resp. "
" All brems and annihilation photons as well as relaxation    "
" particles get latch 3. The real dose to the cavity is then  "
" scored from particles with latch 0,1,3, the dose with       "
" attenuation and scatter removed from latch 0,1,2. That dose "
" is simply D/Awall, so that                                  "
