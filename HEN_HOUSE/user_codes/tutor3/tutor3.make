#  The .make file MUST be present in the user code directory, even if it is
#  just an empty file.
#
#  The .make file can be used to
#
#  - change the standard set of files needed to build a user code by including
#    a "SOURCES = ..." statement.
#
#  - modify the compilation options, e.g.,
#    FCFLAS = -fno-automatic -finit-local-zero
#    to make all local variables static with G77.
#
#  - Pass C preprocessor directive on the command line, e.g.,
#    FCFLAGS = $(FCFLAGS) -Dmy_code

# In the case of the tutor 1-7 codes, we use the .make file to remove the
# egs_c_utils.o file from the link step (because no parallel processing is
# being used).
