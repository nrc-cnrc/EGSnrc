"   Subroutine for sampling incoherent (Compton) scattering        "
"   If the flag ibcmp(region) is zero, Klein-Nishina is used.      "
"   Otherwise scattering is modelled in the impuls approximation   "
"    (see R.Ribberfors and K.F.Berggren, Phys.Rev.A26 (1982) 3325) "
"   As the total cross section from PEGS4 is not modified (and thus"
"   calculated using Klein-Nishina), all rejections leed to an     "
"   unscattered photon and a zero energy electron.                 "
"   If a K,L1,L2,L3,M or N vacancy is created, the subsequent      "
"   atomic relaxation is treated in RELAX. This has as a           "
"   consequence that more than one particle can be created as a    "
"   result of an incoherent scattering. The user should therefore  "
"   check their user codes for possible inconsistencies.           "
"   This version ignores the function F(cos(theta),pz).            "
"   This leads to a small error (at least compared to the cross    "
"   section we want to sample) at low energies (say, below Z keV)  "
"   The advantage is that it is substantially faster then the      "

" The following is a set of macros and subroutines that implement
" bremsstrahlung sampling from the S. Seltzer (NIST) cross sections
" (which are the basis for ICRU radiative stopping powers, into the
" EGSnrc environment) or the NRC cross sections, which are essentially
" the same as NIST, but with corrections to the electron-electron
" contribution (corrections are only significant for low values of
" atomic number Z and low values of the emitted photon energy k.
"
" In order to use it, you have to `turn on' this option by
" setting ibr_nist (which is in COMON/BREMPR/) to ibr_nist=1 for the
" original NIST data (nist_brems.data) or ibr_nist=2 for the NRC
" data (nrc_brems.data).
"
" If this option is turned on, subroutine HATCH will call
" subroutine init_nist_brems.
" In init_nist_brems the NIST cross sections are read in,
" total bremsstrahlung cross sections are calculated using
" 64 point Gauss-Legendre quadrature, the interpolation arrays
" that are used for total cross sections and brems fraction interpolations
" (esig0, esig1, ebr10, ebr11               for electrons)
" (psig0, psig1, pbr10, pbr11, pbr20, pbr21 for positrons)
" are updated and alias sampling tables for rapid sampling of brems
" energies are created. These alias sampling tables are then used
" during the simulation in subroutine BREMS.
" Be aware that there is a slight inconsistency when using this option
" as resttricted radiative stopping powers used are the ones coming
" from PEGS and so, they are calculated using Bethe-Heitler.
" This will not matter at all if
"   - AP is much smaller than the electron energy
"       and/or
"   - the restricted radiative stopping power is much smaller
"     then the restricted collision stopping power
" Both conditions are usually satisfied.
