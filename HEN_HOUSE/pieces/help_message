where [args] is one or more of the following arguments:


 -h or --help                 Print this message and exit

 -i or --input ifile          Specifies that the input file is ifile.egsinp

 -o or --output ofile         Output data will be writtent to ofile.egslog,
                              ofile.egslst, etc., instead of ifile.egslog,
                              ifile.egslst, etc.

 -p or --pegs-file file_name  Use the pegs4 data file file_name.pegs4dat.
                              The system will look for it in the HEN_HOUSE
                              and and the users pegs4 data areas

 -H or --hen-house dir        Change the HEN_HOUSE to be dir instead of the
                              directory specified in the machine.macros file.

 -e or --egs-home dir         Change EGS_HOME to be dir instead of the
                              directory specified by the EGS_HOME
                              environment variable

 -b or --batch                Specify a batch run. The difference between
                              a batch run and an interactive run is that in
                              batch mode unit 6 is connected to a file,
                              whereas in intarctive mode unit 6 output goes
                              to the standard output. The file name in batch
                              run is determined as follows:
                              * it is set to ofile.egslog, if ofile was
                                specified with the -o option
                              * it is set to ifile.egslog, if there was no
                                -o option used but an input file was
                                specified with -i
                              * it is set to test.egslog, if neither -i nor
                                -o was used.
