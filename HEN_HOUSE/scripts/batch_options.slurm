#  Various definitions for job sumbission using Slurm. This file gets sourced

# The name of the command used to submit jobs to the queue
batch_command=sbatch

generic_bo="-n1"

# Flag to specify where the output from this job should go.
# If it is not empty, the job output will be send to input_file.eo
# where input_file is the name of the input file or input_file_wX.eo
# where X is the job number in the case of a parallel run.
# If there is no such option (e.g. `at'), just leave it empty.
#
output_bo="-o"

# Flag to specify how to name the request.
# Giving the job request a name is handy as it helps us find it in a long
# list of running or waiting jobs. The job request will be normally
# named usercode_inputfile where usercode is the name of the user code
# and input file the name of the input file.
# If there is no such option (e.g. `at'), just leave it empty.
#
rname_bo="-J"

# Should the batch submission script sleep between jobs ?
# (only relevant for parallel job submission)
# If the following is left empty, the script will not sleep.
# Sleeping time > 0 is only necessary for PBS because PBS is
# extremely fast in sumbitting jobs but gets confused if many
# jobs are submitted quickly. A sleep time of 1 second is sufficient
# on out system,
#
batch_sleep_time=1

# Some queueing systems (e.g. PBS) have a limitation on the
# maximum length of a job name (e.g. for PBS this is 15).
# The following variable specifies such a limit and the
# job name is truncated to that length if necessary in the
# job submission script.
#
batch_mnl=100

# Set the Slurm partition names used in your cluster.
# Change these if you have defined different queues.
