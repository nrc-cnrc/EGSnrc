## IAEA phase space shared library

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) created a standard phase space
format to share data across computer codes and platforms. The source code provided
in this directory builds into a shared library that is used by EGSnrc to read
and write phase space files in the IAEA format.

The code is copyrighted by IAEA and distributed under fully permissive terms;
please see the copyright and permission notices inside the source code files.
The `utilities.cpp` code authored by Jeffrey Siebers is included, under similar
terms.
