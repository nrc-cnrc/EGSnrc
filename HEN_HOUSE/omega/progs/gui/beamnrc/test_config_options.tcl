#
#  This code is part of the BEAMnrc code system for Monte Carlo simulation of
#  radiotherapy treatments units. BEAM was originally developed at the
#  National Research Council of Canada as part of the OMEGA collaborative
#  research project with the University of Wisconsin, and was originally
#  described in:
#
#  BEAM: A Monte Carlo code to simulate radiotherapy treatment units,
#  DWO Rogers, BA Faddegon, GX Ding, C-M Ma, J Wei and TR Mackie,
#  Medical Physics 22, 503-524 (1995).
#
#  BEAM User Manual
#  DWO Rogers, C-M Ma, B Walters, GX Ding, D Sheikh-Bagheri and G Zhang,
#  NRC Report PIRS-509A (rev D)
#
#  As well as the authors of this paper and report, Joanne Treurniet of NRC
#  made significant contributions to the code system, in particular the GUIs
#  and EGS_Windows. Mark Holmes, Brian Geiser and Paul Reckwerdt of Wisconsin
#  played important roles in the overall OMEGA project within which the BEAM
#  code system was developed.
#
#  There have been major upgrades in the BEAM code starting in 2000 which
#  have been heavily supported by Iwan Kawrakow, most notably: the port to
#  EGSnrc, the inclusion of history-by-history statistics and the development
#  of the directional bremsstrahlung splitting variance reduction technique.
