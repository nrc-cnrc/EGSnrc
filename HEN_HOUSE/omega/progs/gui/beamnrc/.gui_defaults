!  This code is part of the BEAMnrc code system for Monte Carlo simulation of
!  radiotherapy treatments units. BEAM was originally developed at the
!  National Research Council of Canada as part of the OMEGA collaborative
!  research project with the University of Wisconsin, and was originally
!  described in:
!
!  BEAM: A Monte Carlo code to simulate radiotherapy treatment units,
!  DWO Rogers, BA Faddegon, GX Ding, C-M Ma, J Wei and TR Mackie,
!  Medical Physics 22, 503-524 (1995).

!  NRC Report PIRS-509A (rev D)
!
!  As well as the authors of this paper and report, Joanne Treurniet of NRC
!  made significant contributions to the code system, in particular the GUIs
!  and EGS_Windows. Mark Holmes, Brian Geiser and Paul Reckwerdt of Wisconsin
!  played important roles in the overall OMEGA project within which the BEAM
!  code system was developed.
!
!  There have been major upgrades in the BEAM code starting in 2000 which
!  have been heavily supported by Iwan Kawrakow, most notably: the port to
!  EGSnrc, the inclusion of history-by-history statistics and the development
!  of the directional bremsstrahlung splitting variance reduction technique.
