" List of component modules:
" **************************
"
"  The list of identifiers of components to be included in the accelerator model
"  is defined in the $CM_LIST replacement macro.  This must be modified prior
"  to the MORTRAN compile step in order to generate an executable program with a
"  different sequence and set of component modules.  The component modules must
"  be listed in order of increasing Z.
"
"  The type of each component module is indicated in the $CM_TYPE macro.
"
"  This is the end of beam_cm_macros.hdr but the beam script will insert
"  a couple of macros here with the required lists.
"
" The following is an example for a 2 CM case using CM SLABS and CHAMBER,
"  identifiers FOILS and ION_CH
"
"  REPLACE{$CM_LIST} WITH {CMLIST(
"         ION_CH,
"         FOILS
"     )}
"  REPLACE{$CM_TYPE} WITH {CMTYPE(
"         CHAMBER,
"         SLABS
"     )}
