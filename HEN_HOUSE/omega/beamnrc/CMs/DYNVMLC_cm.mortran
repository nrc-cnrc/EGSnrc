"                          GENERAL DESCRIPTION
"                          *******************
"
"   This set of routines is used in conjunction with BEAM.MORTRAN to
"   simulate one component module of a clinical linear accelerator:
"
"   This component module can be added to the simulation by including these
"   routines in the MORTRAN file BEAM_CM.MORTRAN and including the MORTRAN
"   replacement macros associated with this component module in the file
"   BEAM_COMMON.MORTRAN.  The order of the component modules in either of
"   these files is unimportant.  To explicitly include this component module
"   the simulation it must be included in the $CM_LIST replacement statement.
"   The component modules in this list are stacked sequentially for the
"   simulation, one on top of the other, and must not overlap.
"
"   1>. This module can be used as single or double focus multileaf
"       collimators.
"   2>. Used as x or y direction parallel to the leaf.
"   3>. it can have max 100 leaf which are equal width, symmetrical
"       arranged with y axis or x axis.
"   4>. Each leaf has two separate parts which can be moved in the leaf
"       direction independently.
"   5>. Rules to obey:
"           i.  Input the top z coordinates  as ZMIN_$DYNVMLC
"              and thickness respectively.
"           ii. Input the num of leaf and the total width of the leaf, each
"               leaf will have equal width.
"           iii. All leaf have the same material structures.
"           iv. The outside of the leaf will be the same material as leaf
"           v.  Input the focus points for both directions(x and y). each
"               leaf will be single or double focused according to the user.

"I>   Example
"I>   *******
"I>
"I>   The following example defines a multi-leaf tungsten collimator design
"I>   based loosely on that used with the Varian Millenium MLC.
"I>   Actual parameters are DIFFERENT - this serves just as a template.
"I>   Do not attempt to use these parameters for a simulation of the real
"I>   machine.
"I>
"I>   The collimator starts at Z=48.25 cm and has 60 tungsten leaves opening
"I>   in the X direction. Leaves 1-10 and 51-60 are FULL and leaves 11-50 are
"I>   TARGET/ISOCENTER pairs.  The Z focus of the leaf sides is at Z=0 cm
"I>   which is the position of the source. The leaf ends are rounded with a
"I>    radius of 8 cm. In this example, leaf opening coordinates are chosen to
"I>   create a square of width ~ 2cm centred on the beam axis.
"I>
"I>   Electrons and photons in both the collimator and the opening regions
"I>   will be followed down to kinetic energies of 189 keV (ECUT=0.7,
"I>   PCUT=0.01).  Dose deposited in the tungsten leaves will be stored
"I>   in dose zone 2, and dose deposited in the opening will be stored
"I>   in dose zone 1.

"      Whenever a particle is to be transported to a component module
"      boundary in HOWFAR, the subroutine WHERE_AM_I is called.  The

"      that component module, transferring the particle direction.
"      The region number that the particle is about to enter is
"      determined in WHERE_AM_I_$DYNVMLC from the knowledge of which
"      surface the particle is entering through (front if IDIR=1,
