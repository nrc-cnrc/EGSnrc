"    This CM assumes XMIN is negative and XMAX is positive.  This feature
"    was inherited from both ARCSTP and SIDETUBE.  It was not modified to

"I>
"I>   In this example, ECUT, and PCUT in all regions are set to 0.7 MeV
"I>   and 0.01 MeV respectively.  Note that IREPEAT is set to 1 for the
"I>   first chamber so that ECUT, PCUT, etc only have to be input once
"I>   for all chambers and once for all septa.  Also, DOSE_ZONE will
"I>   be incremented automatically for the chambers, so that the chambers
"I>   will have dose zones 1-10.

"
" WHERE_AM_I routine for an arc-shaped ion chamber
"
" WHERE_AM_I_$ARCCHM determines the new region # when a particle traverses
" a component module boundary.  The scheme is as follows:
"
"      Whenever a particle is to be transported to a component module
"      boundary in HOWFAR, the subroutine WHERE_AM_I is called.  The
"      current component module and particle direction (backwards or
"      forwards) are transferred to WHERE_AM_I in the CALL statement.
"      WHERE_AM_I determines which component module the particle is
"      about to enter and calls the WHERE_AM_I_$ARCCHM subroutine for
"      that component module, transferring the particle direction.
"      The region number that the particle is about to enter is
"      determined in WHERE_AM_I_$ARCCHM from the knowledge of which
"      surface the particle is entering through (front if IDIR=1,
"      back if IDIR=-1) and the (X,Y) coordinates of the particle.
"      The current particle being transported is NP (in /STACK/).
"
