"                          GENERAL DESCRIPTION
"                          *******************
"
"   This set of routines is used in conjunction with BEAM.MORTRAN to
"   simulate one component module of a clinical linear accelerator:
"
"   This component module can be added to the simulation by including these
"   routines in the MORTRAN file BEAM_CM.MORTRAN and including the MORTRAN
"   replacement macros associated with this component module in the file
"   BEAM_COMMON.MORTRAN.  The order of the component modules in either of
"   these files is unimportant.  To explicitly include this component module
"   the simulation it must be included in the $CM_LIST replacement statement.
"   The component modules in this list are stacked sequentially for the
"   simulation, one on top of the other, and must not overlap.
"
"   1>. This module can be used as single or double focus multileaf
"       collimators.
"   2>. Used as x or y direction parallel to the leaf.
"   3>. it can have max 100 leaf which are equal width, symmetrical
"       arranged with y axis or x axis.
"   4>. Each leaf has two separate parts which can be moved in the leaf
"       direction independently.
"   5>. Rules to obey:
"           i.  Input the top z coordinates  as ZMIN_$SYNCHDMLC
"              and thickness respectively.
"           ii. Input the num of leaf and the total width of the leaf, each
"               leaf will have equal width.
"           iii. All leaf have the same material structures.
"           iv. The outside of the leaf will be the same material as leaf
"           v.  Input the focus points for both directions(x and y). each
"               leaf will be single or double focused according to the user.

"I>   Example
"I>   *******
"I>
"I>   The following example defines a multi-leaf tungsten collimator design
"I>   based loosely on the TrueBeam high-definition mlc (HD120).
"I>   Actual parameters are DIFFERENT - this serves just as a template.
"I>   Do not attempt to use these parameters for a simulation of the real
"I>   machine.
"I>
"I>   The collimator starts at Z=47.0 cm, is 7 cm thick and has 80 tungsten
"I>   leaves opening in the X direction. Leaves 1-10 and 71-80 are FULL
"I>   (type 1), leaves 11-24 and 57-70 are HALF TARGET/HALF ISOCENTER
"I>   pairs, and leaves 25-56 are QUARTER TARGET/QUARTER ISOCENTER pairs.
"I>   The Z focus of the leaf sides is at Z=0 cm which is the position of the
"I>   source. The leaf ends are straight and also focused at Z=0 cm.
"I>   In this example, the mlc is being run in step-and-shoot mode
"I>   MODE=2 with the leaf opening coordinates read in from the file
"I>   specified

"
" WHERE_AM_I routine for a stacked right cylinder slabs.
"
" WHERE_AM_I_$SYNCHDMLC determines the new region number when a particle
" traverses a component module boundary.  The scheme is as follows:
"
"      Whenever a particle is to be transported to a component module
"      boundary in HOWFAR, the subroutine WHERE_AM_I is called.  The
"      current component module and particle direction (backwards or
"      forwards) are transferred to WHERE_AM_I in the CALL statement.
"      WHERE_AM_I determines which component module the particle is
"      about to enter and calls the WHERE_AM_I_$SYNCHDMLC subroutine for
"      that component module, transferring the particle direction.
"      The region number that the particle is about to enter is
"      determined in WHERE_AM_I_$SYNCHDMLC from the knowledge of which
"      surface the particle is entering through (front if IDIR=1,
"      back if IDIR=-1) and the (X,Y) coordinates of the particle.
"      The current particle being transported is NP (in /STACK/).
