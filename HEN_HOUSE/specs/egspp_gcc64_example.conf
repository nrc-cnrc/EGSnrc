# Linking against the geometry (and possible other) DSO(s)
# -L$(abs_dso) tells the linker to look in
# $HEN_HOUSE/egs++/dso/$my_machine for the egspp library.
# The -Wl,-rpath,$(abs_dso) is specific to the GNU linker
# and has as a result the absolute path to the egspp is encoded
# in the executable using the library. Without this option,
# the path to libegspp.so must be in the search path for shared
# libraries in order libegspp.so to be found.
# On many, but not all, systems this is achieved by adding
# $HEN_HOUSE/egs++/dso/$my_machine to the environment variable
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH
