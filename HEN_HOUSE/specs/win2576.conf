# compilers. Unfortunately, some Fortran compilers insert a default 
# main function and then complain about multiply defined main 
# (theirs and the main of the user code written in C), unless a special 
# flag is passed. For instance, the PGI compiler needs -Mnomain. 
# As I don't know how to test for this feature, it is left up to you 
# to read the documentation of your compiler and adjust FC_FLAGS in 
# case it does not work.
