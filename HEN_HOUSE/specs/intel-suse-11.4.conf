#  EGSnrc configuration file
#
#  This is a working example configuration file for the INTEL compiler suite
#  version 12.0.0 on openSUSE 11.4 (x86_64), codename Celadon.
#
#  ATTENTION: This file is just for reference! You can however load it in
#  either egs_gui or egs_inprz with the configuration tool and create the
#  proper machine specific files machine.mortran, machine.macros, machine.f
#  as well as compile the C utilities files.
#
#  One could also use the script $HEN_HOUSE/scripts/configure from its
#  location, but the EGS_CONFIG file will be created from scratch through
#  a series of user-provided inputs.
#
#  BEWARE: HEN_HOUSE must be set to the proper location below !!!!

# The following is for creating a DSO
# (dynamic shared object, also known as DLL in the Windows world)
# At this point we don't have a procedure in place to determine
# the compile/link flags necessary to create a DSO.
# We therefore put generic values here that are known to work
# on Linux with the GNU, PGI and Intel compilers, on Windows
# with the GNU compiler and on IRIX with the SGI compiler.
# It is up to the user to adjust if this does not work for them.
# Note that the -Wl,-Bsymbolic option is needed on the systems tested
# to make fortran common blocks local to the DSO.
#
SHLIB_FLAGS = -shared -Wl,-Bsymbolic

# When using the INTEL compiler version 12 on Linux, one must
# link against the static libifcoremt_pic.a library, otherwise
# I/O is shared between the main process and the library and output
# goes to the logical unit in the library.
# The following variable is set to be empty, but if you use
# the INTEL compiler version 12 set it to
# /opt/intel/lib/intel64/libifcoremt_pic.a (or wherever your
# static g2c library is installed).
#
SHLIB_LIBS = -Wl,--whole-archive /opt/intel/lib/intel64/libifcoremt_pic.a -Wl,--no-whole-archive

# Use the following make variable in EGSnrc user codes that

# Use the following variable in EGSnrc user codes that
# use a BEAMnrc user code compiled and linked as a DSO
# (dynamic shared object, a.k.a DLL in the Windows world)
# as a particle source.
#
BEAMLIB_OBJECTS = $(HEN_HOUSE)lib/$(my_machine)/load_beamlib.o

# load_beamlib uses system calls to load a DSO and to resolve the addresses
# of the various functions in the DSO (dlopen and dlsym on Unix,
# LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress on Windows). On Linux, Windows with GCC
# and various other Unixes the system library that must be linked to get
# access to these system calls is dl. If this is not the case for you,
# adjust accordingly.
#
BEAMLIB_EXTRA_LIBS = -ldl $(IAEA_LIB)

# FC_FLAGS gets used for compiling the EGSnrc fortran routines and for
# linking for EGSnrc user-codes written in C. We set FC_FLAGS by
# default to be given by $(FCFLAGS) $(FOPT). This is OK for most
# compilers. Unfortunately, some Fortran compilers insert a default
# main function and then complain about multiply defined main
# (theirs and the main of the user-code written in C), unless a special
# flag is passed. For instance, the PGI compiler needs -Mnomain.
# As I don't know how to test for this feature, it is left up to you
# to read the documentation of your compiler and adjust FC_FLAGS in
# case it does not work.
#
FC_FLAGS = $(FOPT) $(FCFLAGS)

# The following variables are needed to define the IAEA phase space library
# and the way EGSnrc user codes link against it.
