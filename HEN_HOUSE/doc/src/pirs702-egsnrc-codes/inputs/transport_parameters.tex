                        Default is On. The effect of using On is twofold:
                        - In photo-electric absorption events, the element
                          (if material is mixture) and the shell the photon
                          is interacting with are sampled from the appropriate
                          cross seections
                        - Shell vacancies created in photo-absorption events
                          are relaxed via emission of fluorescent X-Rays,
                          Auger and Koster-Cronig electrons.
                         Make sure to turn this option on for low energy
                         applications.

Atomic relaxations, Rayleigh scattering, Photoelectron angular sampling
and Bound Compton scattering can also be turned On/Off on a
region-by-region basis. An example for Atomic relaxations on a region-
by-region basis is:

\begin{verbatim}
       Atomic relaxations= On in Regions   or
       Atomic relaxations= Off in regions
\end{verbatim}

Then define the regions in which you want the feature to be turned on:

\begin{verbatim}
       Bound Compton start region=
       Bound Compton stop region=
                or
       Rayleigh start region=
       Rayleigh stop region=
                or
       Relaxations start region=
       Relaxations stop region=
                or
       PE sampling start region=
       PE sampling stop region=
\end{verbatim}
each followed by a list of one or more start and stop regions
separated by commas. Example:
\begin{verbatim}
        Atomic relaxations= On in Regions
        Relaxations start region=  1, 40
        Relaxations stop region=  10, 99
\end{verbatim}
will first turn off relaxations everywhere and
then turn on in regions 1-10 and 40-99.
Note that the input is checked against minimum and maximum
region number and ignored if
\verb+start region < 1+ or \verb+stop_region > $MXREG+ or
\verb+start region > stop region+.

\verb+ECUT+, \verb+PCUT+ and \verb+SMAX+ can also be set on a
region-by-region basis. To do so, include in the input file
\begin{verbatim}
         Set XXXX=              f_value1, f_value2, ...
         Set XXXX start region= i_value1, i_value2, ...
         Set XXXX stop region=  j_value1, j_value2, ...
\end{verbatim}
where \verb+XXXX+ is \verb+ECUT+, \verb+PCUT+ or \verb+SMAX+,
\verb+f_value1+, \verb+f_value2+,...
are the desired values for \verb+XXXX+ and \verb+i_value_i+ and
\verb+j_value_i+ are the start and stop regions.
