              IWATCH = 0 for normal output (the default)
                     = 1 output for every discrete interaction
                     = 2 output for every electron/photon step as well
                     = 4 outputs file for graphics
                     = -N set to 2 on history N, set to 0 on all other
                          histories (for debugging purposes)
              ISTORE = 0 store rn seeds for the 1st history of a batch
                     = 1 store initial rn status (unit 2) for each history
                         being simulated
                     =-1 start first history with rn status from file (unit 2)
                         This is a debugging tool. If run quits, rerun with
                         ISTORE=1, then again ISTORE=-1 and IWATCH = 1/2
                         and/or the debugger on.
            IRESTART = 0 first run for this data set (the default)
                     = 1 restart of a previous run
                     = 2 just create the input file and exit
                     = 3 read in the raw data from a previous run and do
                        the statistical analysis on dose etc.
                     = 4 read in the .egsdat files from parallel jobs
                         having the same base name as the input file but
                         with the extension _w#, where #
                         can be any positive integer.  These .egsdat files
                         will be summed and then the result analyzed similar
                         to IRESTART=3.
              IO_OPT = 0 phase-space output at each scoring plane(the default)
                     = 1 no phase-space output when particles cross scoring
                         plane
                     = 2 no phase-space output but do data analysis for
                         simplified source models
                     = 3 phase-space output up to 100 k particle histories
                         then do analysis only for simplified source models
                     = 4 output phase space in IAEA format
              IDAT   = 0 store data arrays for re-use (takes time but safer)
                     = 1 don't store them
       LATCH_OPTION  = 0 defaults to 2
                     = 1 LATCH for secondaries not inherited from primaries
                         Bits 1-23 set for all regions particle is in
                     = 2 LATCH bits set for all regions particle is in
                         and inherited by secondaries
                         also record bit regions where secondaries created
                         and whether they were created by brem photons
                     = 3 = option 2 but the region numbers are recorded
                         for photons where they interact rather than where
                         they pass through
             IZLAST  = 0 do not score ZLAST etc. (the default)
                     = 1 score the z-position of the last site of interaction
                         for photons and creation of electrons by a photon.
                     = 2 score the xyz-position of the last site of
                         interaction in the file $.egs4gph to be used by
                         EGS_WINDOWS. IWATCH=4 must not be used at same time.
                         Note that for phase space inputs, ZLAST is passed
                         through, but XLAST and YLAST are not.
