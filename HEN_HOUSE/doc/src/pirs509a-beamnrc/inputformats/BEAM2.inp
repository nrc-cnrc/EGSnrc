      FS,SSD,(NMIN),(ICM_DBS,ZPLANE_DBS,IRAD_DBS,ZRR_DBS)  (3F12.0 or 6F12.0)
                  FS = radius of field (cm) into which bremsstrahlung photons
                       must be directed if they are to be split (IBRSPL=2)
                       or length of side of square field (cm) in which 
                       selective bremsstrahlung splitting probabilities are
                       calculated for IBRSPL=29.
                 SSD = distance from bremsstrahlung target where FS
                       is defined.  FS and SSD only define an angle which is
                       used (IBRSPL=29).
                NMIN = background bremsstrahlung splitting number (ie even
                       outside the field, bremsstrahlung events will be
                       split into NMIN photons). Also equal to the
                       higher generation brem splitting number
                       and annihilation photon splitting number if IRRLTT=2.
                       NMIN is only required for IBRSPL=29.
         ICM_DBS and   These are only required to define the splitting
                       plane if IBRSPL=2.  As soon as
          ZPLANE_DBS   a fat electron reaches ZPLANE_DBS within CM number
                       ICM_DBS, it gets split NBRSPL times.  This is designed
                       to improve electron statistics in the current
                       implementation of directional bremsstrahlung
                       splitting (DBS).  If ICM_DBS=0, then no electron
                       splitting is done (recommended if only good photon
                       statistics are required).  Note that ZPLANE_DBS is
                       the index of the plane within ICM_DBS, not the Z
                       position of the plane.  Usually, ICM_DBS will
                       be the CM number of the flattening filter in the
                       accelerator.  If this is modelled using FLATFILT
                       or CONESTAK, then ZPLANE_DBS will denote the layer
                       no. (starting from the top).  If the flattening
                       filter is modelled using CONS3R, then only two
                       planes are available: ZPLANE_DBS=1 is the plane
                       at the top of the structure and ZPLANE_DBS=2 is the
                       plane at the bottom of the structure.  Currently,
                       only FLATFILT, CONESTAK and CONS3R support these 
                       inputs.  Usually ZPLANE_DBS is the plane defining the
                       bottom of the flattening filter.
            IRAD_DBS   Set to 1 if you want the NBRSPL split electrons
                       to be distributed in a radially-symmetric manner
                       about the beam axis.  Note that the beam must be
                       radially symmetric above the splitting plane for this 
                       to make sense.  Set to 0 (the default) otherwise.
            ZRR_DBS    Z position of the russian roulette plane (cm).  Only 
                       required if IBRSPL=2.  This defines the Z 
                       position of a plane within the geometry below which
                       non-fat photons about to undergo a compton, pair
                       or photoelectric event will NOT be subject to 
                       russian roulette and compton, pair or photoelectric
                       events from fat photons will be split NBRSPL times.
                       This is designed to increase the number of electrons
                       (albeit with a lower weight) below this plane and
                       is only used if electron splitting is on (ie
                       ICM_DBS above is > 0).  Note that radiative events 
                       (bremsstrahlung, annihilation) of non-fat electrons
                       below this plane are not split. Usually, the Russian
                       Roulette plane is above the electron splitting plane,
                       and so it is within the flattening filter
                       but somewhere above the bottom.  Note that ZRR_DBS is 
                       in cm whereas the electron splitting plane must be
                       on a horizontal boundary in a CM.
