   ISOURC = 24   FULL PHASE-SPACE SOURCE INCIDENT FROM USER-DEFINED ANGLE
   ***********

   Inputs identical to ISOURC = 21 with the following additional line of
   inputs after SPCNAM:

      ALPHA24,BETA24,DIST24

               ALPHA24   Angle of rotation of source plane about X-axis
                         in degrees.  Positive angle is clockwise rotation.
                         (-90 < ALPHA24 < 90)
                BETA24   Angle of rotation of source plane about Y-axis
                         in degrees.  Positive angle is counter-clockwise
                         rotation. (-90 < ALPHA24 < 90)
                DIST24   Distance of point of rotation above INIT_ICM.

      Note restriction that if ALPHA24~=0 and/or BETA24 ~=0, then INIT_ICM
      must be > 1.  This is because the rotation will result in some
      particles incident within INIT_ICM-1.  Also, the following CMs
      currently do not handle the general case of a forward-directed particle
      incident from within them:
      APPLICAT,ARCCHM,CHAMBER,CIRCAPP,CONESTAK,DYNJAWS,JAWS,MESH,PYRAMIDS,
      SIDETUBE
      Thus, if ALPHA24~=0 and/or BETA24 ~=0 and INIT_ICM or INIT_ICM-1 is
      one of these, negative ustep errors may result.

      The initial idea and much of the coding for Source 24 is courtesy of
      Patrick Downes at University of Cardiff, Wales.
