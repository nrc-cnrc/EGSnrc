   ISOURC = 24   FULL PHASE-SPACE SOURCE INCIDENT FROM USER-DEFINED ANGLE
   ***********

   Inputs identical to ISOURC = 21 with the following additional line of
   inputs after SPCNAM:

      ALPHA24,BETA24,DIST24

               ALPHA24   Angle of rotation of source plane about X-axis
                         in degrees.  Positive angle is clockwise rotation.
                         (-90 < ALPHA24 < 90)
                BETA24   Angle of rotation of source plane about Y-axis
                         in degrees.  Positive angle is counter-clockwise
                         rotation. (-90 < ALPHA24 < 90)
                DIST24   Distance of point of rotation above INIT_ICM.

      Note restriction that if ALPHA24~=0 and/or BETA24 ~=0, then INIT_ICM
      must be > 1.  This is because the rotation will result in some
      particles incident within INIT_ICM-1.  Also, both INIT_ICM and
      INIT_ICM-1 must be SLABS, SIDETUBE or FLATFILT, since these are the
      only CMs currently capable of determining initial regions for particles
      incident within them.

      The initial idea and much of the coding for Source 24 is courtesy of
      Patrick Downes at University of Cardiff, Wales.
