    Example
    *******

    The following example is a model of a cesium source parallel to
    the X-axis.  The source has radius 0.9cm and is made of cesium
    chloride, CSCL700.  This source cylinder is contained within an
    aluminum (AL700ICRU) cylinder of outer radius 1.25cm.  The
    aluminum-cesium chloride assembly is contained in a stainless steel
    (STEEL700ICRU) cylinder of inner radius 2.25cm and outer radius 2.4cm.
    Note that the airgap between the aluminum and stainless steel is
    modelled as a cylinder of air having outside radius 2.25cm.  The
    cylindrical source assembly extends from X=-1.25cm to X=1.25cm.  The
    volume of air in which the source assembly is located starts at
    ZMIN=-2.4cm and has a thickness, ZTHICK=4.8cm, allowing it to just
    contain the source assembly in the Z-direction.  Setting ZMIN=-2.4cm
    allows the cylinders comprising the source assembly to be centered at
    the reference plane (ZCYL=0).

    In this example, ECUT, and PCUT in all regions are set to 0.7MeV
    and 0.01MeV respectively.  The cesium source has dose zone 1; the
    aluminum surrounding it has dose zone 2; the air between the aluminum
    and the stainless steel outer tube has dose zone 3; and the stainless
    steel tube has dose zone 4.
