    Example
    *******
                   
    The following example is an arc-shaped ion chamber containing 10 
    individual chambers.  Used for the tomotherapy prototype under
    development at the UW.
 
    In this example, ECUT, and PCUT in all regions are set to 0.7 MeV
    and 0.01 MeV respectively.  Note that IREPEAT is set to 1 for the
    first chamber so that ECUT, PCUT, etc only have to be input once
    for all chambers and once for all septa.  Also, DOSE_ZONE will
    be incremented automatically for the chambers, so that the chambers
    will have dose zones 1-10.
