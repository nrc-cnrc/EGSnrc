        ZMIN is calculated from ZRAD, ZSRC, and PHI

   12  ZMAX_$ARCCHM (F15.0):  The max Z of the CM in cm.  Note that
                              ZMAX must be >= ZSRC+ARCTHICK+FRONTHCK+

    Repeat 13-14 for the following regions:
          Region 1:  region before arc-shaped ion chamber.
          Region 2:  front face of arc-shaped ion chamber.
          Region 3:  ends of the ion chamber.
          Region 4 -- 2*NUMCHM+2: chamber or septa
                EVEN:  chamber   ODD: septa  Numbering of chambers and
                septa goes from -Y to +Y  (13-14 only have to be
                repeated twice for these regions if IREPEAT=1.  See
                below.)
          Region 2*NUMCHM+3:  back face of arc-shaped ion chamber.
          Region 2*NUMCHM+4:  region surrounding the arc.
          Region 2*NUMCHM+5:  x walls of the chamber

   13  ECUT, PCUT, DOSE_ZONE, IREGION_TO_BIT, (IREPEAT) (2F15.0,2I5,(I5)):

           ECUT, PCUT:  Cutoff energies for electrons and photons
            DOSE_ZONE:  Dose scoring flag
       IREGION_TO_BIT:  Bit setting for the region
              IREPEAT:  Only input for Region 4.  Set to 1 to apply this
                        ECUT, PCUT, IREGION_TO_BIT and MED_IN to all
                        chambers (if DOSE_ZONE > 0, then it will be
                        incremented automatically for each chamber) and the
                        following ECUT, PCUT, DOSE_ZONE, IREGION_TO_BIT and
                        MED_IN to all septa.

   14  MED_IN (24A1):  Medium of region
                       used to set MED_INDEX.

    Example
    *******

    The following example is an arc-shaped ion chamber containing 10
    individual chambers.  Used for the tomotherapy prototype under
    development at the UW.

    In this example, ECUT, and PCUT in all regions are set to 0.7 MeV
    and 0.01 MeV respectively.  Note that IREPEAT is set to 1 for the
    first chamber so that ECUT, PCUT, etc only have to be input once
    for all chambers and once for all septa.  Also, DOSE_ZONE will
    be incremented automatically for the chambers, so that the chambers
    will have dose zones 1-10.
