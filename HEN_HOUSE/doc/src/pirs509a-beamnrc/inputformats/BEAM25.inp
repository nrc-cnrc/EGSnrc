        Global SMAX=     Global (in all regions) maximum step-size
                         restriction for electron transport (in cm).
                         No SMAX restriction is necessary if the electron
                         step algorithm is PRESTA-II and the EXACT boundary
                         crossing algorithm (the default) is used.  In this 
                         case, SMAX will default to 1e10.  However, if either
                          Electron-step algorithm= PRESTA-I
                          or
                          Boundary crossing algorithm= PRESTA-I,
                         then a step-size restriction is necessary, and
                         SMAX will default to 5 cm.
