                           EGSnrc INPUTS 
                           *************
     (modified from the description in $HEN_HOUSE/src/get_inputs.mortran)
 
   The input for parameters associated with EGSnrc follows a format
   used by all the standard EGSnrc user codes.  The rest of the BEAMnrc
   input has not been changed because the GUI's make the details of the
   format irrelevant.
 
   All input associated with selection of EGSnrc transport parameters
   is not crucial for the execution as there are default values set.
   Therefore, if some of the input options in this section are
   missing/misspelled, this will be ignored and defualt parameter assumed
   As the transport parameter input routine uses get_inputs, a lot
   of error/warning messages may be produced on UNIT 15, though.
   If you don't have the intention of changing default settings,
   simply ignore the error messages.
 
   The delimeters are
                :start mc transport parameter:
                :stop mc transport parameter:
 
   Currently, the following options are available (case does not matter and
              the internal variables are shown in [ ] brackets):
