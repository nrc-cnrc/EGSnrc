      IQIN,ISOURC,INIT_ICM,ISRC_DBS,ALPHA24,BETA24,DIST24
              IQIN       dummy NOT USED. Set = 9 for this source by BEAMnrc
              ISOURC     = 23
              INIT_ICM   particles start at front surface of this CM
                         (INIT_ICM is actually read as a real)
              ISRC_DBS   Set to 1 if you are using directional bremsstrahlung
                         splitting (DBS) in the BEAM simulation source 
                         and you wish to reject fat photons (not aimed into
                         the splitting field).  These fat photons compromise
                         statistics.  Set to 0 otherwise.
               ALPHA24   Angle of rotation of source plane about X-axis
                         in degrees.  Positive angle is clockwise rotation.
                         (-90 < ALPHA24 < 90)
                BETA24   Angle of rotation of source plane about Y-axis
                         in degrees.  Positive angle is counter-clockwise 
                         rotation. (-90 < ALPHA24 < 90)
                DIST24   Distance of point of rotation above INIT_ICM.
 
      Note restriction that if ALPHA24~=0 and/or BETA24 ~=0, then INIT_ICM
      must be > 1.  This is because the rotation will result in some
      particles incident within INIT_ICM-1.  Also, the following CMs
      currently do not handle the general case of a forward-directed particle
      incident from within them:
      APPLICAT,ARCCHM,CHAMBER,CIRCAPP,CONESTAK,DYNJAWS,JAWS,MESH,PYRAMIDS,
      SIDETUBE
      Thus, if ALPHA24~=0 and/or BETA24 ~=0 and INIT_ICM or INIT_ICM-1 is
      one of these, negative ustep errors may result.

   ***********
 
      the_beam_code, the_pegs_file, the_input_file (3A80)
 
        the_beam_code    The name of the BEAM code you are running as a
                         source (ie BEAM_sourceaccelname).  This must have 
                         been compiled as a shared library 
                         (libBEAM_accelname.so or BEAM_accelname.dll) and 
                         exist in EGS_HOME/bin/config.
        the_pegs_file    The pegs data set used by the BEAM simulation source
                         (no .pegs4dat extension).  This must be in
                         HEN_HOUSE/pegs4/data or EGS_HOME/pegs4/data.
        the_input_file   The input file used to run the BEAM simulation
                         source (no .egsinp extension).  This must exist in 
                         your EGS_HOME/BEAM_sourceaccelname directory.  It 
                         must be a working input file and must be set up to 
                         write a phase space file at a single scoring plane.
                         This plane becomes where particles are sampled from
                         for the second-stage BEAMnrc simulation (no phase 
                         space file is scored, however).
