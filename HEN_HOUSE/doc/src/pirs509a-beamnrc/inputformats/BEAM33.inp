   ISOURC = 23   BEAM SIMULATION SOURCE
   ***********

      IQIN,ISOURC,INIT_ICM,ISRC_DBS,ALPHA24,BETA24,DIST24
              IQIN       dummy NOT USED. Set = 9 for this source by BEAMnrc
              ISOURC     = 23
              INIT_ICM   particles start at front surface of this CM
                         (INIT_ICM is actually read as a real)
              ISRC_DBS   Set to 1 if you are using directional bremsstrahlung
                         splitting (DBS) in the BEAM simulation source
                         and you wish to reject fat photons (not aimed into
                         the splitting field).  These fat photons compromise
                         statistics.  Set to 0 otherwise.
               ALPHA24   Angle of rotation of source plane about X-axis
                         in degrees.  Positive angle is clockwise rotation.
                         (-90 < ALPHA24 < 90)
                BETA24   Angle of rotation of source plane about Y-axis
                         in degrees.  Positive angle is counter-clockwise
                         rotation. (-90 < ALPHA24 < 90)
                DIST24   Distance of point of rotation above INIT_ICM.

      Note restriction that if ALPHA24~=0 and/or BETA24 ~=0, then INIT_ICM
      must be > 1.  This is because the rotation will result in some
      particles incident within INIT_ICM-1.  Also, both INIT_ICM and
      INIT_ICM-1 must be SLABS, SIDETUBE or FLATFILT, since these are the
      only CMs currently capable of determining initial regions for particles
      incident within them.

   ***********

      the_beam_code, the_pegs_file, the_input_file (3A80)

        the_beam_code    The name of the BEAM code you are running as a
                         source (ie BEAM_sourceaccelname).  This must have
                         been compiled as a shared library
                         (libBEAM_accelname.so or BEAM_accelname.dll) and
                         exist in EGS_HOME/bin/config.
        the_pegs_file    The pegs data set used by the BEAM simulation source
                         (no .pegs4dat extension).  This must be in
                         HEN_HOUSE/pegs4/data or EGS_HOME/pegs4/data.
        the_input_file   The input file used to run the BEAM simulation
                         source (no .egsinp extension).  This must exist in
                         your EGS_HOME/BEAM_sourceaccelname directory.  It
                         must be a working input file and must be set up to
                         write a phase space file at a single scoring plane.
                         This plane becomes where particles are sampled from
                         for the second-stage BEAMnrc simulation (no phase
                         space file is scored, however).
