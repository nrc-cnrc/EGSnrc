         jaws_file: The full name of a file containing jaw opening data
                    in the following format:

                          number is compared to a random number on [0,1] at
                          the start of each history; if the random number is
                          <= INDEX_$DYNVMLC(J), then, if MODE_$DYNJAWS=2,
                          settings J are used.  If MODE_$DYNJAWS=1, then
                          the settings used are a linear interpolation
                          between fields J-1 and J based on the random
                          number selected.  See manual for more details.

    Example
    *******
   
   The following input defines a single tungsten jaw oriented in the Y
   direction operating in step-and-shoot (MODE_$DYNJAWS=2) mode. 
   The jaw settings (Z position, opening coordinates) are defined
   in the file $OMEGA_HOME/beamnrc/CMs/dynjaw.opening.file
   (included with the distribution).
