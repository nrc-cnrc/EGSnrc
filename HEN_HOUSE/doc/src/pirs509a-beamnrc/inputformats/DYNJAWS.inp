            ISCM_MAX_$DYNJAWS = Number of paired bars or jaws in CM.

                             1 for dynamic settings with simulated
                               jaw movement while beam is on
                             2 for step-and-shoot jaw movement--beam
                               off while jaw settings are changed

    3  XY_CHOICE (A1):  indicate orientation of the paired bars/jaws
                         X means bars/jaws perpendicular to x axis

         XBN_$DYNJAWS(I):  negative bar/jaw x or y coodinate at back.

    Next input is only required if MODE_$DYNJAWS=1 or 2

    4a jaws_file (A80)

         jaws_file: The full name of a file containing jaw opening data
                    in the following format:

       NFIELDS_$DYNJAWS (I10)
       FOR J=1,NFIELDS_$DYNJAWS[

       where:

       NFIELDS_$DYNJAWS:  Total number of jaw settings.
       INDEX_$DYNJAWS(J):  Index of setting J. 0 <= INDEX_$DYNVMLC(J) <= 1
                          and INDEX_$DYNVMLC(J) > INDEX_$DYNVMLC(J-1).  This
                          number is compared to a random number on [0,1] at
                          the start of each history; if the random number is
                          <= INDEX_$DYNVMLC(J), then, if MODE_$DYNJAWS=2,
                          settings J are used.  If MODE_$DYNJAWS=1, then
                          the settings used are a linear interpolation
                          between fields J-1 and J based on the random
                          number selected.  See manual for more details.

           DOSE_ZONE:      Dose scoring zone of air surrounding bars.
           IREGION_TO_BIT: This region associated with this bit in LATCH

    Repeat 6 and 7 for I=1,ISCM_MAX_$DYNJAWS

           ECUT, PCUT:     Cutoff energies for electrons and photons in

    7   MED_IN (24A1):  Medium of jaw I, used to set MED_INDEX.

    Example
    *******

   The following input defines a single tungsten jaw oriented in the Y
   direction operating in step-and-shoot (MODE_$DYNJAWS=2) mode.
   The jaw settings (Z position, opening coordinates) are defined
   in the file $OMEGA_HOME/beamnrc/CMs/dynjaw.opening.file
   (included with the distribution).
