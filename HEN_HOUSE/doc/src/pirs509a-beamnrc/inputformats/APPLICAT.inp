    Example
    *******
   
   The following set of cards defines an applicator consisting of 2 
   0.2cm-thick Al scrapers.  The scrapers are separated by 8cm of air. 
   Scrapers can be thought of as made of 4 bars arranged in a rectangle
   orthogonal to the Z axis.  For both scrapers in this example, the half-
   width of the openings created by the bars is 2cm in x, 4cm in y, and the
   width of the bars themselves is 1cm in x, 1.5cm in y.  The front scraper
   starts at Z=60.5 cm.
 
   Electrons will be followed in the CM down to kinetic energies of 
   10 keV (total energies of 0.521 MeV) and photons will be followed down 
   to energies of 1 keV.  The dose deposited in the air will be scored and 
   added to the dose from the other regions in dose scoring zone 1, and the 
   dose deposited in both scrapers will be scored and added to the dose 
   from the other regions in dose scoring zone 2.  There is a minimum 0.1 cm 
   air gap at the front and back of the scrapers CM so that the applicator
   bars are completely surrounded by air.
