      IQIN,ISOURC,GAMMA,ZFOCUS,RTHETAIN,THETAIN
              IQIN       charge of the incident beam (defaults to 0)
              ISOURC     =  15
              GAMMA      half angle of the cone swept by the beam (degrees)
              ZFOCUS     Z position of the apex of the cone (cm)
              RETHETAIN  radius at which THETAIN, the divergence angle of the
                         beam, is specified (cm).  RTHETAIN must be > 0.
              THETAIN    divergence angle of the beam (degrees).  If GAMMA
                         is not 0, then THETAIN can be set to 0; otherwise
                         it must be > 0.

       Note that particles are always incident at Z_min_CM(1), regardless of
       the value of ZFOCUS
