              IQIN    charge of the incident beam (defaults to 0)

              RBEAM   radius of parallel beam in cm (defaults to max radius)
              UINC    incident X-axis direction cosine (UINC < 0.0)
              VINC    incident Y-axis direction cosine
              WINC    incident Z-axis direction cosine
