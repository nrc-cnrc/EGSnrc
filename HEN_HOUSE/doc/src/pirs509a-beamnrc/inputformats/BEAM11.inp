                 (NOTE: beam facing X-AXIS, I.E., UINC should be < 0.0   )
                 (this source should only be used together with CM XTUBE )

      IQIN,ISOURC,RBEAM,UINC,VINC,WINC
              IQIN    charge of the incident beam (defaults to 0)
              ISOURC  =  10
              RBEAM   radius of parallel beam in cm (defaults to max radius)
              UINC    incident X-axis direction cosine (UINC < 0.0)
              VINC    incident Y-axis direction cosine
              WINC    incident Z-axis direction cosine
                      Note: (UINC,VINC,WINC) get automatically normalized
                            defaults to (-1.0,0.0,0.0)
