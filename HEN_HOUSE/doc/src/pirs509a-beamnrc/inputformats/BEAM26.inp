        ESTEPE=          Maximum fractional energy loss per step.
                         Note that this is a global option only, no
                         region-by-region setting is possible. If missing,
                         the default is 0.25 (25%).

        XImax=           Maximum first elastic scattering moment per step.
                         Default is 0.5, NEVER use value greater than 1 as
                         this is beyond the range of MS data available.

        Boundary crossing algorithm=
                         There are two selections possible: EXACT and
                         PRESTA-I.  PRESTA-I means that boundaries will
                         be crossed a la PRESTA.  That is, with lateral
                         correlations turned off at a distance given by
                         `Skin depth for BCA' (see below) from the boundary
                         and MS forced at the boundary.  EXACT means
                         the algorithm will cross boundaries in a single
                         scattering (SS) mode, the distance from a boundary
                         at which the transition to SS mode is made is
                         determined by `Skin depth for BCA' (see below).
                         Default is EXACT since PRESTA-I may result in
                         significant dose overestimates when CHAMBER is
                         used as a phantom, and EXACT will not significantly
                         increase CPU time in most accelerators.

        Skin depth for BCA=
                         Determines the distance from a boundary (in elastic
                         MFP) at which the algorithm will go into single
                         scattering mode (if EXACT boundary crossing) or
                         switch off lateral correlations (if PRESTA-I boundary
                         crossing). Default value is 3 for EXACT or
                         exp(BLCMIN)/BLCMIN for PRESTA-I (see the PRESTA paper
                         for a definition of BLCMIN). Note that if you choose
                         EXACT boundary crossing and set Skin depth for BCA
                         to a very large number (e.g. 1e10), the entire
                         calculation will be in SS mode. If you choose
                         PRESTA-I boundary crossing and make Skin depth for
                         BCA large, you will get default EGS4 behaviours
                         (no PRESTA)
