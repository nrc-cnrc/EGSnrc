                         region-by-region setting is possible. If missing,

        XImax=           Maximum first elastic scattering moment per step.
                         Default is 0.5, NEVER use value greater than 1 as
                         this is beyond the range of MS data available.

                         There are two selections possible: EXACT and
                         PRESTA-I.  PRESTA-I means that boundaries will
                         be crossed a la PRESTA.  That is, with lateral
                         correlations turned off at a distance given by
                         `Skin depth for BCA' (see below) from the boundary
                         and MS forced at the boundary.  EXACT means
                         the algorithm will cross boundaries in a single
                         scattering (SS) mode, the distance from a boundary
                         at which the transition to SS mode is made is
                         determined by `Skin depth for BCA' (see below).
                         Default is EXACT since PRESTA-I may result in
                         significant dose overestimates when CHAMBER is
                         used as a phantom, and EXACT will not significantly
                         increase CPU time in most accelerators.

        Skin depth for BCA=
                         If Boundary crossing algorithm= PRESTA-I
                         then this is the distance from the boundary (in
                         elastic MFP) at which lateral correlations will be
                         switched off.  The default in this case is to
                         calculate a value based on the scattering power at
                         ECUT (same as PRESTA with EGS4).  If
                         Boundary crossing algorithm= EXACT (default) then
                         this is the distance from the boundary (in elastic
                         MFP) at which the algorithm will go into single
                         scattering mode and defaults to 3 mfp.
                         Note that if you choose EXACT boundary crossing and
                         set Skin depth for BCA to a very large number (e.g.
                         1e10), the entire calculation will be in SS mode.
                         If you choose PRESTA-I boundary crossing and make
                         Skin depth for BCA large, you will get default EGS4
                         behaviour (no PRESTA).
