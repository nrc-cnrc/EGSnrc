              IQIN       dummy NOT USED. Set = 9 for this source by BEAMnrc
              ISOURC     = 21
              INIT_ICM   particles start at front surface of this CM
                         (INIT_ICM is actually read as a real)
              NRCYCL     Number of times to recycle each particle in a phase
                         space source.  Each particle in the phase space
                         file is used a total of NRCYCL+1 times before
                         going on to the next particle.
                         If NRCYCL is set <=0 then NRCYCL is automatically
                         calculated to use the entire phase space file with no
                         restarts.  The calculated NRCYCL does not take into
                         account particles that are rejected because they
                         miss the geometry.
                         If NRCYCL is set > 0, then the user-input value is
                         used.
                         If NCASE > no. of particles in the phase space file,
                         then use of NRCYCL is essential for accurate
                         statistics.  If you are unsure of how many times to
                         recycle, use the automatically-calculated value of
                         NRCYCL.  If this still results in many restarts
                         (because of multiple passers being rejected and/or
                         photons rejected because they fall outside the DBS
                         splitting radius--see below)
                         then re-run the simulation with NRCYCL set manually
                         to:
                         NCASE/(NNPHSP-NNPHSP*(NPASS_ph_sp+NFAT_ph_sp)/
                                     (NTOT_ph_sp+NPASS_ph_sp+NFAT_ph_sp) ) -1
                         where NNPHSP is the no. of particles in the file,
                         NTOT_ph_sp is total no. of particles used (not
                         including recycling), NPASS_ph_sp is total no.
                         of multiple passers ignored (not including
                         recycling), and NFAT_ph_sp is the no. of photons
                         rejected (not including recycling because they fall
                         outside the DBS splitting radius at the SSD (only
                         if ISRC_DBS=1--see below)). These numbers are
                         available in the .egslst file.  Always round your
                         calculated value of NRCYCL up.
             IPARALLEL   set >1 if you are distributing the job among
                         IPARALLEL machines.  IPARALLEL is used with PARNUM
                         (see below) to partition a phase space source into
                         IPARALLEL equal parts.
             PARNUM      For each of the IPARALLEL parallel jobs, PARNUM
                         should have a different integer value in the range
                         1<=PARNUM<=IPARALLEL.  The partition of the phase
                         space source that is used for a particular job is
                         then given by:
                            (PARNUM-1)*(NNPHSP/IPARALLEL)<INPHSP<=
                                                 (PARNUM)*(NNPHSP/IPARALLEL)
                         where NNPHSP is the total number of particles in the
                         phsp source and INPHSP is the particle no. chosen.
             ISRC_DBS    Set to 1 if you used directional bremsstrahlung
                         splitting (DBS) in the BEAM simulation used to
                         generate this phase space source and you wish to
                         reject photons not aimed into the splitting
                         field(which are fat).  These fat photons compromise
                         statistics.  Set to 0 otherwise.
             RSRC_DBS    DBS splitting radius in BEAM simulation used to
                         generate this source (cm).  Only used if ISRC_DBS=1.
             SSDSRC_DBS  SSD at which RSRC_DBS was defined in the BEAM sim.
                         used to generate this source (cm). Only used if
                         ISRC_DBS=1.
             ZSRC_DBS    Z where the phase space source was collected in
                         the BEAM simulation used to generate this source(cm).
                         Only used if ISRC_DBS=1.

       Photons are projected from ZSRC_DBS to SSDSRC_DBS and if they will fall
       outside of RSRC_DBS (based on their trajectory) then they will
       be rejected.  This prevents fat photons from compromising statistics.
