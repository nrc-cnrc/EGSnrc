   ***********           ********************************

      Z_min_CM(1)  Z-coordinate of front surface for component module 1
                   This includes any air gap and defines front of model.
                   A common value will be 0.0 except for sources 8 & 9.
                   For most sources except for ISOURC=3, 21 & 31, this is
                   also the source plane on which the particles are incident
           Note that the front of all CMs is given w.r.t. z = 0.0, not
           w.r.t. Z_min_CM(1).

   *************             **********************

   Component module parameters are input in order of their appearance in the
   code, that is, in the order they occur in $CM_LIST.  See the 'INPUT FROM
   UNIT 5' section in each CM subroutine for the list of input parameters.

    There are two lines before the input of parameters for each CM:
    one is *********************************************** ,
    the other is RMAX_CM, the outer boundary(radius or 1/2 of square) of CM
