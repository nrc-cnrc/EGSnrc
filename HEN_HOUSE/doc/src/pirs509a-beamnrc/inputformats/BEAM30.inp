                           Rejection Plane Inputs
                           **********************

   Used to define a rejection plane for use in conjunction with directional
   bremsstrahlung splitting (DBS, IBRSPL=2, see above).
   Inputs can exist without IBRSPL=2, but they will not be used.

   Inputs must appear between the delimiters:
   :Start DBS rejection plane:
   :Stop DBS rejection plane:

   Inputs are:

      Use a rejection plane= Off, On (default is Off)
                            Set to On if you want to define a rejection
                            plane.
                            [USE_REJPLN]
      Z(cm) from zero reference plane= Z position of reference plane.
                            [Z_REJPLN]

      Fat photons and electrons will be discarded if they are about
      to interact at Z>=Z_REJPLN.  Used to prevent correlated particles
      from being created close to a scoring plane, compromising
      statistics.
