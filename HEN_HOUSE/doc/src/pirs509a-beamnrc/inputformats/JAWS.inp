    Repeat 3 and 4 for I=1,ISCM_MAX_$JAWS

    3  XY_CHOICE (A1):  indicate orientation of the paired bars/jaws
                         X means bars/jaws perpendicular to x axis
                        i.e. separation and movement is along x-axis

       XFN_$JAWS(I), XBN_$JAWS(I) (6F15.0)

         ZMIN_$JAWS(I): Distance front of bars/jaws to reference plane.
         ZMAX_$JAWS(I): Distance back of bars/jaws to reference plane.
         XFP_$JAWS(I):  positive bar/jaw x or y coodinate at front.
         XBP_$JAWS(I):  positive bar/jaw x or y coodinate at back.
         XFN_$JAWS(I):  negative bar/jaw x or y coodinate at front.
         XBN_$JAWS(I):  negative bar/jaw x or y coodinate at back.

    5   ECUT, PCUT, DOSE_ZONE, IREGION_to_BIT (2F15.0,2I5): for interior
                                                      (assumed to be AIR)

           ECUT, PCUT:     Cutoff energies for electrons and photons.
           DOSE_ZONE:      Dose scoring zone of air surrounding bars.
           IREGION_TO_BIT: This region associated with this bit in LATCH

    Repeat 6 and 7 for I=1,ISCM_MAX_$JAWS

    6   ECUT, PCUT, DOSE_ZONE, IREGION_TO_BIT (2F15.0,2I5)

           ECUT, PCUT:     Cutoff energies for electrons and photons in
                           jaw I.
           DOSE_ZONE:      Dose scoring zone for jaw I.
           IREGION_TO_BIT: Both bars of jaw I associated with this bit.

    7   MED_IN (24A1):  Medium of jaw I, used to set MED_INDEX.

    Example
    *******

   The following set of cards defines a pair of 5 cm-thick Al jaws.
   The first set of bars open along the X axis.  The inside faces of
   this jaw are vertical at |X|=3cm.  The second set of bars open along
   the Y axis.  The inside
   faces of this jaw are angled out slightly, beginning at |Y|=3cm at the top
   of the jaw and ending at |Y|=3.05cm at the bottom of the jaw.
   The first jaw starts at Z=30.0 cm.  Note the 0.01 cm airgap between
   the two jaws.

   Electrons will be followed in the CM down to kinetic energies of
   10 keV (total energies of 0.521 MeV) and photons will be followed down
   to energies of 1 keV.  The dose deposited in the air will be scored and
   added to the dose deposited in the bars in dose zone 1.
