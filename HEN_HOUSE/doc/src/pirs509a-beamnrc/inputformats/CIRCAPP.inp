                            last scraper)
 
        Note that there is always an air gap (thickness =
        AIRGAPMIN) in the front and the back of this CM.
        Therefore ZBACK_$CIRCAPP should be >= Z of the back face of the 
        last scraper + AIRGAPMIN.

         Note restrictions to allow air gaps between scrapers and
         before the first scraper:
          ZMIN_$CIRCAPP(1)-Z_min_CM >= AIRGAPMIN

    7   MED_IN (24A1):  Medium of the bar of scraper I, used to 
                        set MED_INDEX.
   
    Example 
    *******
   
   The input defines a circular applicator with 2 scrapers, one of Pb with 
   radius of opening = 0.6cm, X and Y half-widths of 1.0cm, and thickness 
   0.5cm. The other scraper, consisting of Al, has an opening with radius 
   2.4cm, X half-width = 4.6cm, Y half-width = 3.2cm, and thickness 1.0cm.  
   The scrapers are separated by 0.1cm of air. The front scraper starts at 
   Z=1.1cm and the second at 1.6 cm.
 
   Electrons will be followed down to kinetic energies of 10 keV (total 
   energies of 0.521 MeV) and photons will be followed down to 1 keV.  The 
   dose deposited in the air will be scored in dose zone 1, and the dose in 
   the 2 scrapers will be scored in dose zones 2 and 3. There is a minimum 
   0.1 cm air gap at the front and back of the CIRCAPP CM.
