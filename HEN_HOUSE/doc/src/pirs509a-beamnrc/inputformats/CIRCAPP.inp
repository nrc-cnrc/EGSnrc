   *****************

   -1  Dummy line to indicate start of CM.

    0  RMAX_CM(ICM_$CIRCAPP) (F10.0): Half-width of outer boundary of CM (cm).

    1  TITLE_$CIRCAPP (60A1):  Title of CM.

    2  ZBACK_$CIRCAPP (F15.0): Z of back face of the CM
                            (air will be added if necessary below the
                            last scraper)

        Note that there is always an air gap (thickness =
        AIRGAPMIN) in the front and the back of this CM.
        Therefore ZBACK_$CIRCAPP should be >= Z of the back face of the
        last scraper + AIRGAPMIN.

    3  N_$CIRCAPP:
         N_$CIRCAPP:  Number of scrapers in the CM.

    Repeat 4 for I=1,N_$CIRCAPP.

       XOUTER_$CIRCAPP(I), YOUTER_$CIRCAPP(I),
       DOSE_ZONE,IREGION_TO_BIT (6F15.0,2I4):

         ZMIN_$CIRCAPP(I):   Z of front face of scraper I. Note that
                             ZMIN_$CIRCAPP(1)-Z_min_CM must be >= AIRGAPMIN.
         ZTHICK_$CIRCAPP(I): Thickness of scraper I.  Note that
                              ZMIN_$CIRCAPP(I+1)-(ZMIN_$CIRCAPP(I)+
                              ZTHICK_$CIRCAPP(I)) must be >= AIRGAPMIN.
         ROPEN_$CIRCAPP(I):   Radius of inner opening in scraper I.
         XOUTER_$CIRCAPP(I):  X half-width of outer edge of scraper I.
         YOUTER_$CIRCAPP(I):  Y half-width of outer edge of scraper I.
         DOSE_ZONE:           Dose scoring zone for the scraper bar.
         IREGION_TO_BIT:      Bit setting number for the scraper bar.

         Note restrictions to allow air gaps between scrapers and
         before the first scraper:
          ZMIN_$CIRCAPP(1)-Z_min_CM >= AIRGAPMIN
          ZMIN_$CIRCAPP(I+1)-(ZMIN_$CIRCAPP(I)+ZTHICK_$CIRCAPP(I)) >=
          AIRGAPMIN

    6   ECUT, PCUT, DOSE_ZONE_AIR,IREGION_TO_BIT_AIR (2F15.0,2I5):

           ECUT, PCUT:     Cutoff energies for electrons and photons for
                           both the bars and the surrounding (air) region
           DOSE_ZONE_AIR:  Dose scoring zone for the surrounding region
      IREGION_TO_BIT_AIR:  Bit set number for the surrounding (air) region

    Repeat 7 for I=1,N_$CIRCAPP.

    7   MED_IN (24A1):  Medium of the bar of scraper I, used to
                        set MED_INDEX.

    Example
    *******

   The input defines a circular applicator with 2 scrapers, one of Pb with
   radius of opening = 0.6cm, X and Y half-widths of 1.0cm, and thickness
   0.5cm. The other scraper, consisting of Al, has an opening with radius
   2.4cm, X half-width = 4.6cm, Y half-width = 3.2cm, and thickness 1.0cm.
   The scrapers are separated by 0.1cm of air. The front scraper starts at
   Z=1.1cm and the second at 1.6 cm.

   Electrons will be followed down to kinetic energies of 10 keV (total
   energies of 0.521 MeV) and photons will be followed down to 1 keV.  The
   dose deposited in the air will be scored in dose zone 1, and the dose in
   the 2 scrapers will be scored in dose zones 2 and 3. There is a minimum
   0.1 cm air gap at the front and back of the CIRCAPP CM.
