                       (ORIENT_$DYNVMLC=0). This approximation is designed
                       to make range rejection more efficient deep in the
                       leaves, while still preserving accurate transport
                       in the leaf ends.  Note that if you have significant
                       air gaps between leaves or are concerned with the
                       effects of the driving screw holes it is recommended 
                       that you not use this option (ie run with the default
                       setting of 0).

    Example
    *******
 
    The following example defines a multi-leaf tungsten collimator design 
    based loosely on that used with the Varian Millenium MLC.
    Actual parameters are DIFFERENT - this serves just as a template.
    Do not attempt to use these parameters for a simulation of the real
    machine.
   
    The collimator starts at Z=48.25 cm and has 60 tungsten leaves opening 
    in the X direction. Leaves 1-10 and 51-60 are FULL and leaves 11-50 are
    TARGET/ISOCENTER pairs.  The Z focus of the leaf sides is at Z=0 cm 
    which is the position of the source. The leaf ends are rounded with a 
     radius of 8 cm. In this example, leaf opening coordinates are chosen to 
    create a square of width ~ 2cm centred on the beam axis.
     
    Electrons and photons in both the collimator and the opening regions 
    will be followed down to kinetic energies of 189 keV (ECUT=0.7,
    PCUT=0.01).  Dose deposited in the tungsten leaves will be stored
    in dose zone 2, and dose deposited in the opening will be stored
    in dose zone 1.
