                       For focused ends the leaf position is defined
                       at ZMIN_$DYNVMLC; for rounded at ZMIN_$DYNVMLC +
                      0.5*ZTHICK_$DYNVMLC (ie center of the leaf in z)

      Repeat 14a until opening coordinates of all leaves are defined once.
      Leaves are numbered 1,2,...TOT_LEAF_$DYNVMLC, where numbering goes from
      leaf 1 to leaf TOT_LEAF_$DYNVMLC. Convention is lower to upper or
      left to right depending on ORIENT_$DYNVMLC i.e from negative to
      positive.  Note that for dynamic or step-and-shoot simulations, these
      are the default coordinates, used unless specified otherwise in the

                          the start of each history; if the random number is
                          <= INDEX_$DYNVMLC(I), then field I is used.
           NEG_$DYNVMLC:  Min. Y (ORIENT_$DYNVMLC=0) or X (ORIENT_$DYNVMLC=1)

     Note that the inputs NEG_$DYNVMLC, POS_$DYNVMLC and NUM_$DYNVMLC have
     the same meanings as in 14a (static field inputs) but that they must
     now be repeated for every field I.

         ECUT, PCUT:  Cutoff energies for electrons and photons.
          DOSE_ZONE:   Dose scoring flag, 0 to not score dose
     IREGION_TO_BIT:   Bit number associated with this region

   16  MED_IN (24A1):  Medium in opening(s) and air gaps

         ECUT, PCUT:  Cutoff energies for electrons and photons.
          DOSE_ZONE:   Dose scoring flag, 0 to note score dose
     IREGION_TO_BIT:   Bit number associated with this region
         IGNOREGAPS:   If set to 1, ignore all air gaps and driving screw
                       holes when doing range
                       rejection in leaf material when the particle X position
                       is < min X of all leaf openings (not including leaf
                       ends) or > max X of leaf openings (not including ends)

                       (ORIENT_$DYNVMLC=0). This approximation is designed
                       to make range rejection more efficient deep in the
                       leaves, while still preserving accurate transport
                       in the leaf ends.  Note that if you have significant
                       air gaps between leaves or are concerned with the
                       effects of the driving screw holes it is recommended
                       that you not use this option (ie run with the default
                       setting of 0).

    Example
    *******

    The following example defines a multi-leaf tungsten collimator design
    based loosely on that used with the Varian Millenium MLC.
    Actual parameters are DIFFERENT - this serves just as a template.
    Do not attempt to use these parameters for a simulation of the real
    machine.

    The collimator starts at Z=48.25 cm and has 60 tungsten leaves opening
    in the X direction. Leaves 1-10 and 51-60 are FULL and leaves 11-50 are
    TARGET/ISOCENTER pairs.  The Z focus of the leaf sides is at Z=0 cm
    which is the position of the source. The leaf ends are rounded with a
     radius of 8 cm. In this example, leaf opening coordinates are chosen to
    create a square of width ~ 2cm centred on the beam axis.

    Electrons and photons in both the collimator and the opening regions
    will be followed down to kinetic energies of 189 keV (ECUT=0.7,
    PCUT=0.01).  Dose deposited in the tungsten leaves will be stored
    in dose zone 2, and dose deposited in the opening will be stored
    in dose zone 1.
