    Example
    *******
   The following input file describes a BLOCK of 4cm thick.
   The block begins at Z=0.0 cm and is made of MILDSTEEL. The air-filled
   opening(s) focus at Z=-10cm. Its positive X boundary begins at XPMAX=4.2cm,
   positive Y boundary at YPMAX=4.8cm, and its negative X boundary at
   XNMAX=-5.0cm, negative Y boundary at YNMAX=-3.0cm.
   There are 2 sub-regions describing one opening shaped like an arrow.
   In the first sub-region, there are 5 defining points; in the second one,
   there are 4 defining points. The defining points should be input
   clockwisely or counter-clockwisely. Each point is input as x, y in
   a line.
   In this particular input file, there is no gap at the top of the
   CM, so Z_min_CM will be automatically reset to -0.01cm to
   provide the required gap.

   Dose in the air regions will be scored in dose zone 1.
   Dose in the block material will be scored in zone 2.
   ECUT and PCUT in all regions are set to 0.521MeV and
   0.01 MeV respectively.
