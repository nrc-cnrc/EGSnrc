    Example
    *******

    The following example defines a multi-leaf collimator design based
    loosely on that used with the Elekta SLiplus 40 leaf pair.
    Actual parameters are DIFFERENT - this serves just as a template.
    Do not attempt to use these parameters for a simulation of the real
    machine.

    The collimator starts at Z=30 cm and has 40 tungsten leaves opening
    in the X direction.  The leaves are each ~0.4cm wide and 7.0 cm
    thick.  In this example, the leaf openings will form a barbel shape
    with its long axis parallel to Y.  It will be slightly off-centre
    due to the leaf bank rotation of -0.01 rads.

    Electrons and photons in both the collimator and the opening regions
    will be followed down to kinetic energies of 10 keV (ECUT=0.521,
    PCUT=0.01).  Dose deposited in the tungsten leaves will be stored
    in dose zone 2, and dose deposited in the opening will be stored
    in dose zone 1.


    In this example the numbers are only approximate, more details should
    be obtained from the vendor
