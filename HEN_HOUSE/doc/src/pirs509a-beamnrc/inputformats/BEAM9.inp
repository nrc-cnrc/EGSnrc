      IQIN,ISOURC,DISTZ,RBEAM
              IQIN    charge of the incident beam (defaults to 0)
              ISOURC  =  8
              DISTZ   SSD (default to 100 cm)
              RBEAM   radius of scanned beam at SSD.  If set <=0 or
                      too large, then RBEAM gets reset to
                      RMAX_CM(1)*DISTZ/Z_min_CM(1) (circular CM 1) or
                      SQRT(2)*RMAX_CM(1)*DISTZ/Z_min_CM(1) (square CM 1)
                      so that particles strike the front of
                      CM 1 within a circle of radius RMAX_CM(1)
                      or SQRT(2)*RMAX_CM(1).
              RBEAM0  Radius of beam spot at Z=0cm.  Defaults to 0
                      if RBEAM0<0 and gets reset to
                      RMAX_CM(1)*DISTZ/Z_min_CM(1)-RBEAM (circular CM 1)
                      or SQRT(2)*RMAX_CM(1)*DISTZ/Z_min_CM(1)-RBEAM
                      (square CM 1) if RBEAM+RBEAM0 >
                      RMAX_CM(1)*DISTZ/Z_min_CM(1) or >
                      SQRT(2)*RMAX_CM(1)*DISTZ/Z_min_CM(1).
     For this source the particles start at Z_min_CM(1) and hence
     Z_min_CM(1) must be >= 0.0
