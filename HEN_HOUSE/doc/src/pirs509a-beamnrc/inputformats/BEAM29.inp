        Photon cross sections= Photon cross-section data.  Current options are
                         si (Storm-Israel), epdl (Evaluated Photon Data
                         Library), xcom (the default), pegs4, mcdf-xcom and
                         mcdf-epdl:
                         Allows the use of photon cross-sections other than
                         from the PEGS4 file (unless the pegs4 option is
                         specified).  Options mcdf-xcom and mcdf-epdl use
                         Sabbatucci and Salvat's renormalized photoelectric
                         cross sections with either xcom or epdl for all other
                         cross sections.  These are more accurate but can
                         increase CPU time by up to 6 %.
                         Note that the user can supply their own cross-section
                         data as well. The requirement is that the files
                         photon_xsections_photo.data,
                         photon_xsections_pair.data,

                         is the name specified.
                         Hence this entry is case-sensitive.

                         a file $EGS_HOME/user_code/inputfile.xsections is

                         implementation is crude. Available on a

                         this input (case sensitive). In the absence of
                         any user-supplied data, or if photonuc_xsections
                         is set to 'default', the default file is

        Atomic relaxations, Rayleigh scattering, Photoelectron angular
        sampling, Bound Compton scattering and Photonuclear attenuation
        can also be turned On/Off on a region-by-region basis.
        To do so, put e.g.

        Atomic relaxations= On in Regions   or
        Atomic relaxations= Off in regions
                          in your input file. Then use the relevant one of:
        Relaxations start region=
        Relaxations stop region=
                 or
        Bound Compton start region=
        Bound Compton stop region=
                 or
        Rayleigh start region=
        Rayleigh stop region=
                 or
        PE sampling start region=
        PE sampling stop region=
                 or
        Photonuclear start region=
        Photonuclear stop region=

              each followed by a list of one or more
              start and stop regions separated by commas.
         Example:
         Atomic relaxations= On in Regions
         Relaxations start region=  1, 40
         Relaxations stop region=  10, 99
                          will first turn off relaxations everywhere and
                          then turn on in regions 1-10 and 40-99.
                          Note that input is checked against min. and max.
                          region number and ignored if
                          start region < 1 or stop_region > $MXREG or
                          start region > stop region.
