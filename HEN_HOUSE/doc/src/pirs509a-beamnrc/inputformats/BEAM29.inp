                          electron impact ionization. If set to 'On' then the
                          theory of Kawrakow is used.  Other settings use the
                          theory associated with the name given.  See future
                          editions of the EGSnrc Manual (PIRS-701) for more
                          details.  This is only of interest in keV X-Ray
                          simulations.  Otherwise, leave it Off.

                          cross-sections from PEGS4)
                          The name of the cross-section data for photon 
                          interactions.  This input line must be left out
                          to access the default Storm-Israel cross-sections
                          from PEGS4.  'edpl' uses cross-sections from the
                          evaluated photon data library (EPDL) from Lawrence 
                          Livermore.  'xcom' will use the XCOM cross-sections
                          from Burger and Hubbell.  The user also has the
                          option of using their own customized cross-section
                          data.  See the BEAMnrc manual for more details.

        Photon cross-sections output= Off (default) or On.  If On, then
                         a file $EGS_HOME/user_code/inputfile.xsections is
                         output containing photon cross-section data used.

        Atomic relaxations, Rayleigh scattering, Photoelectron angular
        sampling and Bound Compton scattering can also be turned On/Off 
        on a region-by-region basis. To do so, put e.g.
        Atomic relaxations= On in Regions   or
        Atomic relaxations= Off in regions
                          in your input file. Then use the relevant one of:
        Relaxations start region=
        Relaxations stop region=
                 or
        Bound Compton start region=
        Bound Compton stop region=
                 or
        Rayleigh start region=
        Rayleigh stop region=
                 or
        PE sampling start region=
        PE sampling stop region=
 
              each followed by a list of one or more
              start and stop regions separated by commas.
         Example:
         Atomic relaxations= On in Regions
         Relaxations start region=  1, 40
         Relaxations stop region=  10, 99
                          will first turn off relaxations everywhere and
                          then turn on in regions 1-10 and 40-99.
                          Note that input is checked against min. and max.
                          region number and ignored if
                          start region < 1 or stop_region > $MXREG or
                          start region > stop region.
