        Pair angular sampling= Off, Simple or KM (Default is Simple)
                         If off, pairs are set in motion at an angle m/E
                         relative to the photon direction (m is electron rest
                         energy, E the photon energy). Simple turns on
                         the leading term of the angular distribution
                         (this is sufficient for most applications),
                         KM (comes from Koch and Motz) turns on using 2BS
                         from the article by Koch and Motz.
                         Always use Simple or KM.

        Pair cross sections= BH (default) or NRC.  If set to BH, then use
                         Bethe-Heitler pair production cross-sections.  If set
                         to NRC, then use NRC pair production cross-sections
                         (in file $HEN_HOUSE/data/pair_nrc1.data).  Only
                         of interest at low energies, where the NRC cross-
                         sections take into account the assymmetry in the
                         positron-electron energy distribution.

        Photoelectron angular sampling= Off or On (Default is Off)
                         If Off, photo-electrons get the direction of the
                         `mother' photon, with On, Sauter's furmula is
                         used (which is, striktly speaking, valid only for
                         K-shell photo-absorption).

                         small difference was a big ion chamber (cavity size
                         comparable with electron range) with high-Z walls
                         in a low energy photon beam.

        Rayleigh scattering= Off, On, custom
                        If On, turned on coherent (Rayleigh) scattering.
                         Default is Off. Should be turned on for low energy
                         applications. Not set to On by default because
                         On requires a special PEGS4 data set.  If set to
                         custom, then media for which custom form factors
                         are to be specified are listed in the input:

                         The effect of using On is twofold:
                         - In photo-electric absorption events, the element
                           (if material is mixture) and the shell the photon
                           is interacting with are sampled from the
                           appropriate cross seections
                         - Shell vacancies created in photo-absorption events
                           are relaxed via emission of fluorescent X-Rays,
                           Auger and Koster-Cronig electrons.
                          Make sure to turn this option on for low energy
                          applications.
