                         relative to the photon direction (m is electron rest
                         energy, E the photon energy). Simple turns on
                         the leading term of the angular distribution

                         from the article by Koch and Motz.
                         Always use Simple or KM.

        Pair cross sections= BH (default) or NRC.  If set to BH, then use
                         Bethe-Heitler pair production cross-sections.  If set
                         to NRC, then use NRC pair production cross-sections

                         sections take into account the asymmetry in the

        Rayleigh scattering= Off, On, custom
                         If On, turn on coherent (Rayleigh) scattering.
                         Default is On. Should be turned on for low energy

        Atomic relaxations= Off, On, eadl, simple
                         Default is eadl.  On defaults to eadl.
                         When simulating atomic relaxations:
                         - In photo-electric absorption events, the element
                           (if material is mixture) and the shell the photon
                           is interacting with are sampled from the
                           appropriate cross sections
                         - Shell vacancies created in photoelectric,
                           compton and electron impact ionization events
                           are relaxed via emission of fluorescent X-Rays,
                           Auger and Koster-Cronig electrons.
                          The eadl option features a more accurate treatment
                          of relaxation events and uses binding energies
                          consistent with those in of the photon cross
                          sections used in the simulation.  If using
                          mcdf-xcom or mcdf-epdl photon cross sections, you
                          cannot use the simple option and this will
                          automatically get reset to eadl.
                          Make sure to use eadl or simple for low energy
                          applications.
