                 (Note beam facing X-axis, i.e., UINC should be < 0.0    )
                 (this source should only be used together with CM XTUBE )
                 (for simulating the target of an X-ray tube.            )

      IQIN,ISOURC,YBEAM,ZBEAM,UINC,VINC
              IQIN    charge of the incident beam (defaults to 0)
              ISOURC  =  13
              YBEAM   half-width of parallel beam in cm (defaults to 0.2 cm)
              ZBEAM   half-height of parallel beam in cm (defaults to 0.2 cm)
              UINC    incident X-axis direction cosine (UINC < 0.0)
              VINC    incident Y-axis direction cosine
                      (incident Z-axis direction cosine WINC default to 0.0)
                      Note: (UINC,VINC) get automatically normalized
                            defaults to (-1.0,0.0,0.0)
