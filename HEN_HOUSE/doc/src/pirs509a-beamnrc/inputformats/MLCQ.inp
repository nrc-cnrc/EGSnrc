    Example
    *******

    The following example defines a multi-leaf collimator
    that starts at Z=65 cm and has 64 tungsten leaves opening
    in the X direction.  The leaves are each 0.8125cm wide and 7.5cm
    thick.  The Z focus of the leaf sides is at Z=-1000 cm, resulting
    in sides that are essentially straight up and down.  The radius
    of the leaf ends is 10cm and has a Z origin of 65cm (ie ZMIN),
    The unique position of the Z origin of the radius means that the X
    dimensions of the opening in each leaf at the top of the collimator
    (ZMIN) will be given by X0N+10 - X0P-10 cm.
    In this example, the X origins of the radii of the individual leaves
    are chosen to create an irregular off-center collimator opening.

    Electrons and photons in both the collimator and the opening regions
    will be followed down to kinetic energies of 10 keV (ECUT=0.521,
    PCUT=0.01).  Dose deposited in the tungsten leaves will be stored
    in dose zone 2, and dose deposited in the opening will be stored
    in dose zone 1.
