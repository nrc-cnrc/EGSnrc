              ESTEPIN Dummy variable (used to be ESTEPE -- max. fractional
                      energy loss/electron step)
              SMAX    Dummy variable (used to be SMAX -- max. step length)
              ECUTIN  electron cut off in MeV - total energy
                      If this is > ECUT as input in the EGSnrc input section
                      (see below), then ECUT is set to ECUTIN.  Default
                      value for ECUT is AE.
              PCUTIN  photon cut off in MeV.  If this is > PCUT as input
                      in the EGSnrc input section (see below), then PCUT
                      is set to PCUTIN.  Default value for PCUT is AP.
              IDORAY  Dummy variable (used to turn Rayleigh scattering on/off)
       IREJCT_GLOBAL = 0 no electron range rejection
                     = 1 do electron range rejection--if residual
                         range to ECUTRR(IRL) is < DNEAR and
                         electron energy is < ESAVE_GLOBAL, terminate
                         history.  ECUTRR(IRL) may vary from component
                         module to component module and is calculated based
                         on the particle making it to the bottom of the
                         accelerator with energy > ECUT
                     = 2 as in =1, but use a non-calculated ECUTRR = ECUT(IRL)
                         this should be used if interested in more
                         than phase-space data at base of simulation
                  =-1,-2 Same as above, but now Russian Roulette is played
                         with ALL electrons that can not escape the region
                         and are not fat. Only applicable with DBS.
        ESAVE_GLOBAL  energy below which an electron will be discarded
                      If E<ESAVE_GLOBAL & the electron cannot escape from the
                      current region with E>ECUTRR(IRL). This ignores brem
                      losses.
              IFLUOR  Dummy variable (used to turn X-ray fluorescence on/off)

         The dummy inputs are retained for compatibility with EGS4/BEAM input
         files.
