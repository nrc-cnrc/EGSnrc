   CARDS CM_$CONS3R (CONS3R: Rev 1.10)
   **************

    -1 Dummy line to indicate start of CM

    0  RMAX_CM(ICM_$CONS3R) (F10.0):  Outer radial boundary of CM (cm).

    1  TITLE_$CONS3R (60A1):  Title of CM.

    2  ZMIN_$CONS3R (F15.0):  Dist from front of cones to
                              reference plane (Z=0).

    3  ZTHICK_$CONS3R (F15.0): The thickness of cones (excludes front air).

    4  NUM_NODE_$CONS3R (I5):  The # of points to be used <$NPOINT_CONS3R.

    Repeat 5 for I=1,NUM_NODE_$CONS3R

    5  ZCORNER_$CONS3R(I), RCORNER_$CONS3R(I) (2F15.0):
         Positions (Z, R) for node I.  First & last must match
         ZMIN_$CONS3R and ZMIN_$CONS3R+ZTHICK_$CONS3R.  Note also the
         restriction Z(I+1) >= Z(I).

    Repeat 6, 7 for inner (ie inside cons3r), then outer region

    6  ECUT, PCUT, DOSE_ZONE, IREGION_TO_BIT, IREJCTIN  (2F15.0,3I5):

          ECUT, PCUT:  Cutoff energies for electrons and photons.
          DOSE_ZONE:   If non-zero, dose in this zone is scored in this
                       dose zone
          IREGION_TO_BIT:   region to LATCH bit correspondence for particles
                       interacting in this region
          IREJCTIN:    If IREJCT_GLOBAL is on, then by setting IREJCT=-1
                       here, range rejection is turned off in this region
                       If left blank or zero, the global value is used.

    7  MED_IN (24A1):  Medium of region
                       used to set MED_INDEX.


    Example
    *******

   The following input example describes a 1cm thick flat-top cone, having
   a radius at the top of 0.8cm and a radius at the bottom of 1.2cm
   sitting on a 0.3cm thick cylinder of radius 1.5cm which, in turn,
   is sitting atop a flat-top cone of thickness 1.0cm with top radius
   0.5cm and bottom radius=0.8cm.  The two cones and cylinder are
   made of H2O--note that all of these structures MUST be of the same
   medium--and they are surrounded by AIR.  Dose in the surrounding
   AIR is stored in dose zone 1, and dose in the cones/cylinder
   structure is stored in zone 2.
