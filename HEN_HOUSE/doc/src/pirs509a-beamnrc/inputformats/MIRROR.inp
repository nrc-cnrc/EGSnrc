    Example
    *******
 
    The following describes a mirror composed of 1 AL slab.
    The front face of the mirror intersects the front of the 
    CM (excluding any airgap) at X=3cm and the back of the CM at X=-3cm.
    The mirror starts at 19.7cm and is 2cm in the z-direction.
    The thickness of the AL slab is 0.00508cm.
    Note that thickness is measured perpendicular to the 
    face of the mirror.  AIR is both in front of and behind
    the AL mirror.  No dose is scored in this example.
