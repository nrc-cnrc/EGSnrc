           Bremsstrahlung Cross Section Enhancement (BCSE) Inputs
           ******************************************************
 
   Inputs for the BCSE variance reduction technique.
 
   Inputs must appear between delimiters:
   :Start BCSE:
   :Stop BCSE:
 
   Inputs are:
 
       Use BCSE= Off, On (default is Off)
               Set to On to use BCSE.
               [USE_BCSE]
       Media to enhance= A list of media in
               which to enhance the bremsstrahlung cross-section.  If
               none of the media is found in the accelerator, then no
               BCSE is done. 
               [is_bcse_medium]
       Enhancement constant= Floating point factor by which bremsstrahlung 
               cross-sections are enhanced. Typical values are in the range
               20 (megavoltage accelerators) -- 500 (x-ray tubes in
               mammography energy range). 
               [BCSE_FACTOR_C]
       Enhancement power= Floating point number that us used for an energy
               dependent BCSE. If this input is <=0, then a constant 
               BCSE factor is used that is given by BCSE_FACTOR_C. But if
               this input is >0, then the BCSE factor is computed on-th-fly
               using 1 + BCSE_FACTOR_C*(E(np)-rm)**BCSE_POWER_N.
               Typical values for BCSE_POWER_N are 2...4. Note that 
               BCSE_FACTOR_C must be adjusted accordingly so that the above
               equations gives a factor of 20 (megavoltage accelerators) --
               500 (low energy x-ray tubes) for the maximum energy of the
               incident electron spectrum.
               If in doubt, just set to <=0 because the gain from an 
               energy dependent BCSE is modest (~20%).
 
   Note that if BCSE is used in conjunction with uniform bremsstrahlung 
   splitting (UBS) or selective bremsstrahlung splitting (SBS), then
   Russian Roulette is automatically turned on (IRRLTT=2--see above).
 
   BCSE is most efficient when used in conjunction with DBS or UBS
