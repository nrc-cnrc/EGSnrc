        Spin effects=    Off, On, (default is On)
                         Turns off/on spin effects for electron elastic
                         scattering. Spin On is ABSOLUTELY necessary for
                         good backscattering calculations. Will make a
                         difference even in `well conditioned' situations
                         (e.g. depth dose curves for RTP energy range
                         electrons).

        Brems angular sampling= Simple, KM, (default is Simple)
                         If Simple, use only the leading term of the Koch-Motz
                         distribution to determine the emission angle of
                         bremsstrahlung photons. If KM, complete
                         modified Koch-Motz 2BS is used (modifications
                         concern proper handling of kinematics at low
                         energies, makes 2BS almost the same as 2BN at low
                         energies).

        Brems cross sections= BH, NIST, NRC, default is BH
                         If BH is selected, the Bethe-Heitler bremsstrahlung
                         cross sections (Coulomb corrected above 50 MeV)
                         will be used. If NIST is selected, the NIST brems
                         cross section data base (which is the basis for
                         the ICRU radiative stopping powers) will be employed.
                         Differences are negligible for E > ,say, 10 MeV,
                         but signifficant in the keV energy range.  If NRC is
                         selected, NIST data including corrections for
                         electron-electron brems will be used (typically only
                         significant for low values of the atomic number Z
                         and for k/T < 0.005).
        Bound Compton scattering=  On, Off or Norej (Default is Off)
                         If Off, Compton scattering will be treated with
                         Klein-Nishina, with On Compton scattering is
                         treated in the Impulse approximation. 
                         Make sure to turn on for low energy applications,
                         not necessary above, say, 1 MeV.  Option Norej
                         uses full bound Compton cross section data
                         supplied in input below and does not reject
                         interactions.

        Compton cross sections= Bound Compton cross-section data.  User-
                         supplied bound Compton cross-sections in the file

                         comp_xsections is the name supplied for this input.
                         This is only used if Bound Compton scattering= Simple
                         and is not available on a region-by-region basis
                         (see below).  The default file (ie in the absence
                         of any user-supplied data) is compton_sigma.data.

        Radiative Compton corrections= On or Off (default). If on, then
                         include radiative corrections for Compton scattering.
                         Equations are based on original Brown & Feynman
                         equations (Phys. Rev. 85, p 231--1952).  Requires
                         a change to the user codes Makefile to include
                         $(EGS_SOURCEDIR)rad_compton1.mortran in the
