        Spin effects=    Off, On, (default is On)
                         Turns off/on spin effects for electron elastic
                         scattering. Spin On is ABSOLUTELY necessary for
                         good back-scattering calculations. Will make a
                         difference even in `well conditioned' situations
                         (e.g. depth dose curves for RTP energy range

        Brems angular sampling= Simple, KM, (default is KM)
                         If Simple, use only the leading term of the Koch-Motz
                         distribution to determine the emission angle of
                         bremsstrahlung photons. If KM, complete
                         modified Koch-Motz 2BS is used (modifications
                         concern proper handling of kinematics at low
                         energies, makes 2BS almost the same as 2BN at low
                         energies).

        Brems cross sections= BH, NIST, NRC, default is BH
                         If BH is selected, the Bethe-Heitler bremsstrahlung
                         cross sections (Coulomb corrected above 50 MeV)
                         will be used. If NIST is selected, the NIST brems
                         cross section data base (which is the basis for
                         the ICRU radiative stopping powers) will be employed.
                         Differences are negligible for E > ,say, 10 MeV,
                         but significant in the keV energy range.  If NRC is
                         selected, NIST data including corrections for
                         electron-electron brems will be used (typically only
                         significant for low values of the atomic number Z
                         and for k/T < 0.005).
        Triplet production= On or Off (default).  Turns on/off simulation
                         of triplet production.  If On, then Borsellino's
                         first Born approximation is used to sample triplet
                         events based on the triplet cross-section data.

        Bound Compton scattering=  On, Off, Simple or norej (default)
                         If Off, Compton scattering will be treated with
                         Klein-Nishina, with On Compton scattering is
                         treated in the Impulse approximation.
                         With Simple, the impulse approximation incoherent
                         scattering function will be used (i.e., no Doppler
                         broadening). With norej the actual total bound
                         Compton cross section is used and there are no
                         rejections at run time.
                         Make sure to use for low energy applications,
                         not necessary above, say, 1 MeV.

        Radiative Compton corrections= On or Off (default). If on, then
                         include radiative corrections for Compton scattering.
