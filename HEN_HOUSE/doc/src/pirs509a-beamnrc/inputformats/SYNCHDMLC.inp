                          the start of each history; if the random number is

   Note that the inputs NEG_$SYNCHDMLC, POS_$SYNCHDMLC and NUM_$SYNCHDMLC have
     the same meanings as in 14a (static field inputs) but that they must
     now be repeated for every field I.

                       is < min X of all leaf openings (not including leaf
                       ends) or > max X of leaf openings (not including ends)

                       to make range rejection more efficient deep in the
                       leaves, while still preserving accurate transport
                       in the leaf ends.  Note that if you have significant
                       air gaps between leaves or are concerned with the
                       effects of the driving screw holes it is recommended
                       that you not use this option (ie run with the default
                       setting of 0).

    Example
    *******

    The following example defines a multi-leaf tungsten collimator design
    based loosely on the TrueBeam high-definition mlc (HD120) but using
    all leaf types.
    Actual parameters are DIFFERENT - this serves just as a template.
    Do not attempt to use these parameters for a simulation of the real
    machine.

    The collimator starts at Z=47.0 cm, is 7 cm thick and has 80 tungsten
    leaves opening in the X direction. Leaves 1-10 and 71-80 are FULL
    (type 1), leaves 11-24 and 57-70 are HALF TARGET/HALF ISOCENTER
    leaves, and leaves 25-56 are QUARTER TARGET/QUARTER ISOCENTER leaves.
    The Z focus of the leaf sides is at Z=0 cm which is the position of the
    source. The leaf ends are straight and also focused at Z=0 cm.
    In this example, the mlc is being run in step-and-shoot mode
    MODE=2 with the leaf opening coordinates read in from the file
    specified
