                          INDEX_$SYNCHDMLC(I) > INDEX_$SYNCHDMLC(I-1).  This
                          number is compared to a random number on (0,1) at
                          the start of each history; if the random number is
                          <= INDEX_$SYNCHDMLC(I), then field I is used.
           NEG_$SYNCHDMLC:  Min. Y (ORIENT_$SYNCHDMLC=0) or 
 			      X (ORIENT_$SYNCHDMLC=1)
                          of front opening in leaf (ie the opening at
                          ZMIN_$SYNCHDMLC) if ENDTYPE=1, or of rounded end
                          of leaf if ENDTYPE=0 for leaf J in field I.
           POS_$SYNCHDMLC:  Max. Y (ORIENT_$SYNCHDMLC=0) or 
  			      X (ORIENT_$SYNCHDMLC=1)
                          of front opening in leaf if ENDTYPE=1, or of
                          rounded end of leaf if ENDTYPE=0 for leaf J in 
                          field I.
           NUM_$SYNCHDMLC:  Apply NEG_$SYNCHDMLC and POS_$SYNCHDMLC to leaves
                          J,...,J+NUM_$SYNCHDMLC-1.  Defaults to 1 if set <=0.
                          Defaults to TOT_LEAF_$SYNCHDMLC-J+1 if set >
                          TOT_LEAF_$SYNCHDMLC-J+1.
 
   Note that the inputs NEG_$SYNCHDMLC, POS_$SYNCHDMLC and NUM_$SYNCHDMLC have
     the same meanings as in 14a (static field inputs) but that they must
     now be repeated for every field I.

         ECUT, PCUT:  Cutoff energies for electrons and photons.
          DOSE_ZONE:   Dose scoring flag, 0 to not score dose
     IREGION_TO_BIT:   Bit number associated with this region

                                                          (2F15.0,3I5):
   
         ECUT, PCUT:  Cutoff energies for electrons and photons.
          DOSE_ZONE:   Dose scoring flag, 0 to note score dose
     IREGION_TO_BIT:   Bit number associated with this region
         IGNOREGAPS:   If set to 1, ignore all air gaps and driving screw
                       holes when doing range
                       rejection in leaf material when the particle X position
                       is < min X of all leaf openings (not including leaf
                       ends) or > max X of leaf openings (not including ends)
                       (ORIENT_$SYNCHDMLC=1) or if the particle Y position
                       is < min Y of all leaf openings (not including leaf
                       ends) or > max Y of leaf openings (not including ends)
                       (ORIENT_$SYNCHDMLC=0). This approximation is designed
                       to make range rejection more efficient deep in the
                       leaves, while still preserving accurate transport
                       in the leaf ends.  Note that if you have significant
                       air gaps between leaves or are concerned with the
                       effects of the driving screw holes it is recommended 
                       that you not use this option (ie run with the default
                       setting of 0).

         ECUT, PCUT:  Cutoff energies for electrons and photons.

     IREGION_TO_BIT:   Bit number associated with this region

                       used to set MED_INDEX.
   
    Example
    *******
 
    The following example defines a multi-leaf tungsten collimator design 
    based loosely on the TrueBeam high-definition mlc (HD120).
    Actual parameters are DIFFERENT - this serves just as a template.
    Do not attempt to use these parameters for a simulation of the real
    machine.
   
    The collimator starts at Z=47.0 cm, is 7 cm thick and has 80 tungsten 
    leaves opening in the X direction. Leaves 1-10 and 71-80 are FULL 
    (type 1), leaves 11-24 and 57-70 are HALF TARGET/HALF ISOCENTER
    pairs, and leaves 25-56 are QUARTER TARGET/QUARTER ISOCENTER pairs.
    The Z focus of the leaf sides is at Z=0 cm which is the position of the 
    source. The leaf ends are straight and also focused at Z=0 cm.
    In this example, the mlc is being run in step-and-shoot mode
    MODE=2 with the leaf opening coordinates read in from the file
    specified
