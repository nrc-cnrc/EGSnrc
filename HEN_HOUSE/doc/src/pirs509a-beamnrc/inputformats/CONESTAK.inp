    Example
    *******

   The following input example describes two conical layers.  The first
   layer is a flat-top cone 1.0cm thick, with a radius at the top of 0.8cm
   and a radius at the base of 1.2cm.  The second layer is a cylinder, also
   1.0cm thick, of radius 1.2cm.  The top cone is made of Cu and the bottom
   cylinder is made of Pb.  The entire structure is encircled by a Pb wall
   with inner radius 4cm and outer radius 5cm.
   In both layers, the medium between the cone and the outer wall is H2O.

   Dose in the Cu cone will be scored in dose zone 1.  Dose in the PB cylinder
   will appear in dose zone 2.  The dose to the encircling PB wall will be in
   zone 3.  And the dose to the water in both layers will be scored in zone 4.
   ECUT and PCUT in all cases is 0.521MeV and 0.01MeV respectively.
