       IFORCE,NFMIN,NFMAX,NFCMIN,NFCMAX
              IFORCE = 0 normal photon transport (the default)
                     = 1 force photon interaction in the geometry
              NFMIN  number of photon interaction/history at which to start
                     photon-interaction-forcing (defaults to 1)--this
                     option has been deleted and NFMIN is now always treated 
                     as 1. 
              NFMAX  number of photon interaction/history after which to
                     stop forcing photon to interact (defaults to 1)
              NFCMIN number of CM to start photon interaction forcing
                     ( default to 1 )
              NFCMAX number of last CM in which photons forced to interact 
                     ( default to max_cms )
                     If a particle passes thru NFCMIN to NFCMAX, it is
                     forced to interact there for the first NFMAX 
                     interactions. The WEIGHT
                     of this photon is reduced and the remaining WEIGHT is
                     carried by another photon which will be transported
