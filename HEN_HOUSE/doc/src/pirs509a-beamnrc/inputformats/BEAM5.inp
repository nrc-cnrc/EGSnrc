              i_dsb   Set to 1 to use directional source biasing.  Note that
                      directional bremsstrahlung splitting (IBRSPL=2) must
                      also be used.  Splitting number (NBRSPL), splitting
                      field radius (FS), source to surface distance
                      (SSD) and electron splitting parameters (if e-
                      contamination is desired) are read from the DBS
                      inputs.
        splitcm_dsb   The CM no. at which primary photons are split and
                      radially redistributed about the Z-axis.  Photons
                      are split/redistributed immediately upon entering
                      CM no. splitcm_dsb.  Note that this should be the
                      the no. of the first CM in the treatment head without
                      radial symmetry.  The number of times a photon is
                      split depends upon the radial bin into which it
                      is directed.  Bin radii are determined by the input
                      dsb_delta below.  Set splitcm_dsb=0 for no splitting/
                      redistribution.
          dsb_delta   The min. linear distance, in cm, between split/
                      redistributed photons, projected to the SSD of the
                      splitting field. dsb_delta is used to divide the
                      splitting field into radial bins, where photons
                      directed into bin i are split i times.

          NOTE: The sign of RBEAM determines if the source will be a
                       vertical ring a horizontal cylinder.
                The Z-span of the source must be in the range
                       Z_min_CM(1)-Z_min_CM(MAX_CMs+1).
                Currently, this source is limited to being placed within
                       CONESTAK, FLATFILT or SIDETUBE
