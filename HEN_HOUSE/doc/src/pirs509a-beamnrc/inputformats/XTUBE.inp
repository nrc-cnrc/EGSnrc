    Example
    *******
 
    The following example describes a tungsten target, 1mm thick,
    mounted on a copper holder.  The target is angled at 22 degrees
    with respect to the z-axis.  It spans 2cm in the z direction.
    The medium in front of the target is AIR.
    ECUT and PCUT for all regions are set to 0.521, 0.01 respectively.
    Note that the input file specifies the target to start at 10cm
    from the reference plane; if Z_min_CM(1) is not 10cm and XTUBE
    is the first CM in the beam, the code will autumatically reset the
    target to start at Z_min_CM(1).
