      ITDOSE_ON 
          ITDOSE_ON  = 0 (DEFAULT) only total dose is calculated 
                     = 1 total dose and dose components may be calculated
 
      There are 2 classes of components. First is selected as dose from
      particles or descendents of particular charge as they cross a
      specified boundary.  Second is based on bit selections in the
      variable LATCH, either inclusive or exclusive sets - i.e. depends
      on where particle has been or interacted.

      ICM_CONTAM, IQ_CONTAM (2I5)
           All particles of type IQ_CONTAM (0=photons, 1=charged
           particles) are identified as contaminants when they enter 
           the front of CM number ICM_CONTAM and their dose is scored as
           contaminant dose in all dose zones.
           If ICM_CONTAM = 0, no contaminant dose is scored.
           LATCH_OPTION = 1 is not allowed with ICM_CONTAM non-zero

                   particles with certain LATCH bits set - i.e. which have
                   not been in certain regions.
                   LNEXC = 0 is allowed. LNEXC <= $MAXIT - 3

                   in LATCH).  LNINC <= $MAXIT - LNEXC - 3

                          These are in two groups/line, separated by a zero.
                          Of the first group of bits, at least one must
                          be set to be in this dose component.
                          The second group need not be present, but if
                          it is, none of these bits can be set to be in
                          this dose component.
