    Example
    *******
   The following input file describes two pyramidal openings,
   both 0.3cm thick, and both filled with air (ie IFILL_$PYRAMIDS=0).
   The first opening begins at Z=0.0 cm and is cut out of Pb.  Its positive
   X face begins at XFP=0.8cm and angles back to XBP=1.2cm.  The negative X
   face is a mirror image, beginning at XFN=-0.8cm and going to XBN=-1.2cm.
   The outer x edge is at XMAX=5.0cm. The Y faces of the first opening are
   perpendicular to the beam, with YFP=YBP=0.8cm and YFN=YBN=-0.8cm. The
   outer y edge is at YMAX=4.6cm.
   The second opening begins at Z=0.31 and is cut out of aluminum.  Its 
   positive and negative X faces describe a parallelepiped, with XFP=1.2cm,
   XBP=0.8cm, XFN=-0.8cm, XBN=-1.2cm.  
   The positive Y face angles from YFP=2.0cm to
   YBP=0.5cm and the negative Y face is a mirror image of this, going from
   XFN=-2.0cm to XBN=-0.5cm. The outer x edge and y edge are at XMAX=5.1cm,
   YMAX=5.2cm respectively. Note that an air gap >= AIRGAPMIN (=0.01cm) must
   be left between pyramids and the top of the CM and the first pyramid.
   In this particular input file, there is no gap at the top of the
   CM, so Z_min_CM will be automatically reset to -0.01cm to
   provide the required gap.
 
   Dose in the air gaps and openings will be scored in dose zone 1.
   Dose in the Pb will be scored in zone 2, and dose in the Al will be
   scored in zone 3.  ECUT and PCUT in all regions are set to 0.521MeV and
   0.01 MeV respectively.
