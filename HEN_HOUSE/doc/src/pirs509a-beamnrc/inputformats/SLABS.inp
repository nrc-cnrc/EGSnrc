    Example
    *******
   
   The following set of cards defines a 1 cm thick slab of air sandwiched
   between two 0.1 cm thick slabs of tungsten.  The front slab is at  
   Z=7.32 cm. Electrons will be followed in the slabs down to kinetic energies
   of 10 keV (total energies of 0.521 MeV) and photons will be followed down 
   to energies of 1 keV.  The dose deposited in the air will be scored and 
   added to the dose from the other regions in dose zone 1, and the 
   dose deposited in both tungsten slabs will be scored and added to the dose 
   from the other regions in dose zone 2.  Particles interacting in
   the first slab will be associated with BIT 1 in LATCH.  In all slabs,
   ESAVEIN=0, thus ESAVE in each slab will default to ESAVE_GLOBAL.
