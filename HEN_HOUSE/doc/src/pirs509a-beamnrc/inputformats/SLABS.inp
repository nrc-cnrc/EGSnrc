    1  TITLE_$SLABS (60A1):  Title of CM.

    2  N_$SLABS (I5):  Number of planar slabs in CM = # regions in CM,
                       excludes any air gap needed.

    3  ZMIN_$SLABS (F15.0):  Distance from front of first slab to reference
                             plane  (Z=0).

    4  Parameters of each slab from front to back (increasing Z).  One pair of
       cards (4a and 4b) for each of the slabs.

               DOSE_ZONE:       Dose zone to score dose - 0 if not scored
               IREGION_TO_BIT:  map this region to this bit number in LATCH
               ESAVEIN:         Value of ESAVE for this region if range

       4b   MED_IN (24A1):  Medium of the planar slab, used to set MED_INDEX.

    Example
    *******

   The following set of cards defines a 1 cm thick slab of air sandwiched
   between two 0.1 cm thick slabs of tungsten.  The front slab is at
   Z=7.32 cm. Electrons will be followed in the slabs down to kinetic energies
   of 10 keV (total energies of 0.521 MeV) and photons will be followed down
   to energies of 1 keV.  The dose deposited in the air will be scored and
   added to the dose from the other regions in dose zone 1, and the
   dose deposited in both tungsten slabs will be scored and added to the dose
   from the other regions in dose zone 2.  Particles interacting in
   the first slab will be associated with BIT 1 in LATCH.  In all slabs,
   ESAVEIN=0, thus ESAVE in each slab will default to ESAVE_GLOBAL.
