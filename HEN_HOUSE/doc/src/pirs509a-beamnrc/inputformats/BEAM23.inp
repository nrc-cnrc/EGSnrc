   ISOURC = 19   PARALLEL ELLIPTICAL BEAM FROM FRONT GAUSSIAN IN X AND Y 
   ***********  
   
      IQIN,ISOURC,RBEAM,UINC,VINC,WINC,sigma_src19,RBEAMY
              IQIN    charge of the incident beam (defaults to 0)
              ISOURC  = 19 
              RBEAM   sigma of the 2-D gaussian distribution (RBEAM > 0) 
                      in the X-direction in cm
                        or
                      -FWHM of 2-D gaussian distribution (RBEAM < 0) in 
                      the X-direction in cm
                      Note: sigma of gaussian distribution is limited to
                            <RMAX_CM(1) for circular CM 1 and
                            <SQRT(2)*RMAX_CM(1) for square CM 1
              UINC    incident x-axis direction cosine
              VINC    incident y-axis direction cosine
              WINC    incident z-axis direction cosine
                      Note: (UINC,VINC,WINC) get automatically normalized
                            defaults to (0.0,0.0,1.0)
       sigma_src19    mean angular spread of particles about Z axis
                      in degrees (none if set <=0).  Overrides incident
                      direction cosines if set > 0, so that beam is assumed
                      to be centred on Z axis.
            RBEAMY    same as RBEAM but for Y-direction.  If set to 0,
                      then RBEAMY=RBEAM for a circular beam.
