                           CUSTOMIZED USER INPUTS
                           **********************

   This section contains inputs that are unique to the user.  In general
   the user must modify beamnrc.mortran to read these inputs from the
   .egsinp file.  Also, the GUI will not give access to these inputs.
   If no custom inputs are required, then this section can be omitted
   entirely.

   Custom user inputs must appear in the .egsinp file between the delimiters:
        :Start user inputs:
        :Stop user inputs:

   This section can appear either just before or just after the EGSnrc
   inputs (see above).

   Currently, the only custom user input hard-coded in beamnrc.mortran
   is:

    PHSP OUTPUT DIRECTORY= /full directory path to where phase space files
                            are to be output, or blank
              This allows the user to specify a directory other than
              $EGS_HOME/BEAM_accelname in which to write phase space data.
              Useful if phase space files are large and, due to disk space
              limitations, must be written to a /temp area.  If left blank
              or omitted entirely, then phase space files are output to the
              default $EGS_HOME/BEAM_accelname directory.
