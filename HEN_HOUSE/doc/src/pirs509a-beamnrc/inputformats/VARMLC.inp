          DOSE_ZONE:   Dose scoring flag, 0 to note score dose
     IREGION_TO_BIT:   Bit number associated with this region
         IGNOREGAPS:   If set to 1, ignore all air gaps when doing range
                       rejection in leaf material when the particle X
                       position
                       is < min X of all leaf openings (not including leaf
                       ends) or > max X of leaf openings (not including ends)
                       (ORIENT_$VARMLC=1) or if the particle Y position
                       is < min Y of all leaf openings (not including leaf
                       ends) or > max Y of leaf openings (not including ends)
                       (ORIENT_$VARMLC=0). This approximation is designed
                       to make range rejection more efficient deep in the
                       leaves, while still preserving accurate transport
                       in the leaf ends.  Note that if you have significant
                       air gaps between leaves, it is recommended that
                       you not use this option (ie run with the default
                       setting of 0).

    18  MED_IN (24A1):  Medium of leaves,
                       used to set MED_INDEX.

    Example
    *******

    The following example defines a multi-leaf collimator design based
    loosely on that used with the Varian Clinac 2100C 26 leaf pair.
    Actual parameters are DIFFERENT - this serves just as a template.
    Do not attempt to use these parameters for a simulation of the real
    machine.

    The collimator starts at Z=50 cm and has 26 tungsten leaves opening
    in the X direction.  The leaves are each 0.5cm wide and 6.0cm
    thick.  The Z focus of the leaf sides is at Z=-1000 cm, resulting
    in sides that are essentially straight up and down.  The Z focus
    of the leaf ends is at Z=0, which is the position of the beam source.
    In this example, leaf opening coordinates are chosen to create a
    pattern of alternating open and closed leaves.

    Electrons and photons in both the collimator and the opening regions
    will be followed down to kinetic energies of 10 keV (ECUT=0.521,
    PCUT=0.01).  Dose deposited in the tungsten leaves will be stored
    in dose zone 2, and dose deposited in the opening will be stored
    in dose zone 1.  Finally, the option to ignore air gaps when doing
    range rejection deep in the leaves is off.
