    Example
    ******* 
 
  The following input example describes a lead mesh placed at Z=100 cm
  in a beam.  The mesh is 0.0299 cm thick, has square air regions 
  with dimensions 0.2159x0.2159cm, and the lead wire separating the air  
  regions is 0.0381cm wide.  Although the RMAX_CM is 10cm, the outer 
  boundary of the mesh itself, as input, is a 6x6cm square.  MESH
  automatically adjusts this boundary to 6.2421x6.2421cm to accommodate
  exactly 49 mesh cells (air regions + half of the wire width 
  surrounding them) in the X and Y directions plus the extra half-thickness
  of wire surrounding the entire mesh and not belonging to any cell.
 
  ECUT and PCUT in all regions are set to 0.521MeV and 0.01MeV
  respectively.  Air regions (cell air + air surrounding mesh) will
  have dose scored in zone 1 and is associated with bit # 1.  The 
  lead wire has dose scored in zone 2 and is associated with bit # 2. 
  
  Note that MESH cannot be the first CM in a simulation, and the
  example given here must be preceeded by at least an airgap modelled
  by another type of CM.
