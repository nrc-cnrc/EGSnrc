    Example
    *******
 
    The following example defines a multi-leaf collimator design based
    loosely on that used with the MM50 Racetrack Microtron accelerator.  
    The collimator starts at Z=65 cm and has 64 tungsten leaves opening 
    in the X direction.  The leaves are each 0.8125cm wide and 7.5cm 
    thick.  The Z focus of the leaf sides is at Z=-1000 cm, resulting 
    in sides that are essentially straight up and down.  The Z focus 
    of the leaf ends is at Z=0, which is the position of the beam source.  
    In this example, leaf opening coordinates are chosen to create a 
    irregular off-center collimator opening. 
     
    Electrons and photons in both the collimator and the opening regions 
    will be followed down to kinetic energies of 10 keV (ECUT=0.521,
    PCUT=0.01).  Dose deposited in the tungsten leaves will be stored
    in dose zone 2, and dose deposited in the opening will be stored
    in dose zone 1.
