    Example
    *******
 
   The following example describes a FLATFILT with 2 layers.  The
   RMAX of this FLATFILT is 2cm.  There is no air gap between the
   first layer and the top of the CM.
 
   The first layer is 0.3 cm thick and comprises a convex cone made
   of H2O within a concave cone made of PB.  The convex H2O cone has
   a top radius of 0.0cm and a bottom radius of 1.0cm.  The concave PB
   cone has a top radius of 1.5cm and a bottom radius of 1.1cm.
   The region between the outer, concave cone and RMAX_CM is AIR.
   The second layer is also 0.3 cm thick and comprises a single
   cylinder of H2O having radius 1cm (ie top radius=bottom
   radius=1cm).  The region between the outer boundary of this 
   cylinder and RMAX_CM (an annular region) is AIR.
 
   The dose to the AIR regions is scored in dose zone 1.  The dose
   to H2O regions (the convex cone in the first layer and the cylinder
   in the second layer) is scored in zone 2.  And the dose to PB
   (the concave cone in the first layer) is scored in zone 3.  
   ECUT and PCUT for all regions are 0.521 MeV and 0.01 MeV
   respectively.
