#  This file determines which files are to be connected to which Fortran
#  I/O unit. Lines starting with # are ignored.
#  The first column is the Fortran I/O unit number, the second a
#  file extension => e.g. unit 1 will be
#  connected to output_file.egslst, etc.
#
#  This .io file is for the NRC user code tutor4.
#  The only additional file is unit 13 for possible output for
#  the EGS_WINDOWS graphics package.
#
#  In the following, unit 13 is connected to test.egsgph  by default.
#  However, by using tutor4 -o file -p tutor_data      to run the code
#  one gets  file.egsgph
#
13 .egsgph
