#  The egs_run script executes this piece of code immediately
#  before and after executing the user code.  The environment file
#  gives the user the ability to link specific file names to the
#  standard names used by fortran and/or any other files they
#  want to use.
#
#  environment files are used extensively by the NRC user codes
#  and the user is advised to look at them for further examples.
#
#  This script can tell whether it is being called before or after
#  execution by the value of the variable $user_operation which is setenv
#  before execution and unsetenv afterwards.
#
#  In the calling script the variable $inputfile has also been set
#  if the user is using one.
#
#  The script egs_run does those assignments needed by all user
#  codes, namely unit 12, pegs4 input, unit 76,77,78,79 other
#  cross-section data.  The user code should not use these units.

if ($user_operation == "setenv") then
    # Preprocessing operations go here

    # This example attaches a usercode-specific plotting input file
    # to FORTRAN unit 9
    ln -s $usercode.my_plotting_package_input fort.9

    # This example attaches an inputfile-specific plotting output file
    # to FORTRAN unit 80
    ln -s $inputfile.my_plotting_package_output fort.80

    #this example attaches a file to the standard EGS_Windows output
    ln -s $inputfile.egsgph fort.13

else if ($user_operation == "unsetenv") then
    # Postprocessing operations go here

    # Note that any symbolic links created above are removed
    # automatically by the scipt egs_run.

else
    # This should not happen but print a message just in case
    echo "Warning. No user_operation set for modifying environment"
