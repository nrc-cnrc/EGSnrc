 [This EGS User Guide to Mortran3 was originally Appendix 4 of SLAC-265.
 This guide was excerpted from SLAC Computation Research Group
 Report CGTM No. 165 (June 1975): "A User's Guide to Mortran2" by
 A. James Cook and L. J. Shustek and modified by the authors to 
 represent Mortran3.]







 With the EGSnrcMP environment, there have been a few changes to the
MORTRAN3 processor.  In source code, C-style comments (viz /* comment */)
are now allowed, and any line starting with a # is output directly without
any processing (this is to allow C-preprocessor statements to be used.

                            PREFACE
 
 
 
      EGS is written in a structured language called Mortran3
      which has been developed at SLAC by A. James Cook and L. J.
      Shustek.  The Mortran3 precompiler is written in 1966 ANSI
      standard FORTRAN IV and 1977 ANSI standard FORTRAN 77, and
      both are included on the EGS4 distribution tape.  This guide,
      which is also maintained on the EGS4 distribution tape, is
      meant to be a brief introduction to Mortran3 to allow EGS4
      users to use it.  For a complete description, the user is
      referred to the "Mortran3 User's Guide" by A. J. Cook, SLAC
      Computation Research Technical Memorandum CGTM-209 (1983).
      
      Although it is possible to write EGS User Codes entirely in
      FORTRAN, we strongly urge you to use Mortran because of how easily
      one can write readable (and therefore more likely correct) code,
      because of its flexibility, and because of its ability to improve
      execution time by allowing for in-line code generation.

\newpage
 \subsection{Introduction} \index{Mortran3!introoduction}
 \begin{verbatim}
      The term Mortran, like FORTRAN, has several meanings,
 depending upon the context in which the term is used.
 Mortran has come to mean:

      - A Structured Language.  - A Translator for that
      language.  - A Macro-processor.

 The structured language is implemented as a set of macros
 which are used by the macro processor to translate
 the language into FORTRAN.  The resulting FORTRAN
 program is then run like any other FORTRAN program.
 User-defined macros are easily added to the standard
 (language-defining) set of macros so that the language is
 "open-ended" in the sense that extensions to the language
 may be made at any time by the user.  Extensions have
 ranged from very simple ones like matrix multiplication,
 to complex ones like those which define new data types.

      Users need not concern themselves with the method of
 implementation or the macro facility in order to take
 advantage of the structured language which is provided
 by the standard set of macros.  The features of this
 language include:

      - Free-field (column and card boundaries may be
      ignored).  - Alphanumeric labels of arbitrary length.
      - Comments inserted anywhere in the text.  - Nested
      block structure.  - Conditional statements which
      may be nested (IF, IF-ELSE,
        and ELSEIF).
      - Loops (repetitively executed blocks of statements)
      which
        test for termination at the beginning or end or
        both or neither (WHILE, UNTIL, FOR-BY-TO, LOOP
        and DO).
      - EXIT (jump out of) any loop.  - NEXT (go to NEXT
      iteration) of any loop.  - Multiple assignment
      statements.  - Conditional (alternate) compilation.
      - Program listing features include:
          - Automatic printing of the nesting level.
          - Automatic indentation (optional) according
          to nesting
            level.
      - Abbreviations for simple I/O statements.  -
      Interspersion of FORTRAN text with Mortran text.
\end{verbatim} 

\newpage \begin{verbatim}

      The user may elect to override the standard set of macros
 and write a set which defines another, perhaps "problem oriented",
 language.
 
      The Mortran3 processor is a FORTRAN program of approximately
 2000 statements.  The 1966 ANSI standard has been observed
 throughout, so that transportability of the processor is assured.
 
 \end{verbatim}
 \subsection{Coding Rules}
 \index{Mortran3!coding rules}
 \begin{verbatim}
 
      Mortran programs may be written without regard to column
 or card boundaries.  Statements may begin anywhere on the input
 line (card image), and may end anywhere on the same line or on
 a succeeding line.  The end of a statement is determined by a
 semicolon (;).  This feature permits "free-field" or "free-form"
 programming.  Normally, only the first 72 columns of the input
 line are intepreted as program text, but this can be changed
 (see Section A4.6).
 
      Character strings comprising Hollerith fields are enclosed
 in apostrophes (as in 'THIS IS HOLLERITH DATA').  If an embedded
 apostrophe is desired as a character within a quoted string,
 use a pair of apostrophes to represent each such embedded apos-
 trophe (as in 'DON''T').
 
      Comments in Mortran are enclosed in quotation marks (as in
 "COMMENT") and may be inserted anywhere in the program (except
 in character strings or macros).
 
      In Mortran, an alphanumeric label is a character sequence
 of arbitrary length enclosed in colons (as in :TOMATOES:).  The
 characters which comprise the sequence may be any combination of
 letters and digits.  An alphanumeric label may be used anywhere
 a FORTRAN statement label is allowed.
 
      Multiple blanks (a sequence of two or more blanks) in a
 Mortran program are equivalent to a single blank except in quoted
 strings, where all blanks are preserved, and in macros (discussed
 in Section A4.5).
\end{verbatim} 
\newpage \begin{verbatim}
 Summary of coding rules:
 
      - Terminate statements with a semicolon (;).
 
      - Enclose comments in quotation marks (").
 
      - Enclose labels in colons (:).
 
      - Enclose character strings in apostrophes (').
 
      - Blanks may be inserted freely except in labels, character
        strings and user-defined macros.
 
      It should be pointed out that any extensions provided by a
 particular FORTRAN compiler may be used, provided that they do
 not conflict with Mortran's coding conventions.  However, if
 transportability of the programs being written in Mortran is
 a consideration, the ANSI FORTRAN standard should be adhered to.
 The standard set of macros which define the language described
 in this Guide do not generate non-ANSI FORTRAN.
 \end{verbatim}
 \subsection{Structure}
 \index{Mortran3!structure}
 \subsubsection{Statements}
 \index{Mortran3!statements}
 \begin{verbatim} 
      FORTRAN may be regarded as a subset of Mortran, since (with
 the exception of multiple blanks in a Hollerith string) any valid
 FORTRAN statement becomes a valid Mortran statement when
 
      - it is terminated by a semicolon, and
      - continuation marks (if any) are deleted.
 
 \end{verbatim}
 \subsubsection{Blocks}
 \index{Mortran3!blocks}
 \begin{verbatim}
     A Mortran block is a sequence of Mortran statements enclosed
 in the special characters [ and ], which we will call "brackets"
 (or "square brackets").  The left bracket may be read "begin"
 and the right bracket may be read "end".  Let
 
                    S1; S2; S3;...Sk;...Sn;              (A4.3-1)
 
 be a sequence of statements.  The sequence becomes a block when
\end{verbatim} 
\newpage \begin{verbatim}
 it is enclosed in brackets
 
                  [ S1; S2; S3;...Sk;...Sn; ]  .         (A4.3-2)
 
 (Note: the ellipses (...) are meta-symbols indicating arbitrary
 repetition.  The brackets are not meta-symbols; they are
 delimiters in the Mortran language).
 
      Blocks may be nested.  That is, any of the statements in
 a block may be replaced by a block.  For example, in sequence
 (A4.3-2) we could replace Sk by a block and write
 
      [ S1; S2; S3;...[ T1; T2; T3;...Tm; ]...Sn; ]      (A4.3-3)
 
 The block containing the sequence T1;...Tm; is completely
 contained, or nested, within the block containing the sequence
 S1;...Sn;.  We will frequently write an ellipsis enclosed in
 brackets [...] to denote a block.
 
      Example of a block:   [ X=Y; CALL SUB(A); B=1; ]   .
 
 \end{verbatim}
 \subsubsection{Conditional Statements}
 \index{Mortran3!conditional statements}
 \begin{verbatim}
 
      The simplest form of a conditional statement in Mortran is
 written
                    IF e [...]                           (A4.3-4)
 
 where e is an arbitrary logical expression, and the ellipsis
 enclosed in brackets denotes a block as described above.  If e
 is true then the statements in the block are executed.   If e
 is false, control is transferred to the first statement following
 the block.  For example:
 
                    IF A.LT.B [ C=D; E=F; ] G=H;
 
 If A is less than B then the statements C=D and E=F are executed
 after which G=H is executed.  If A is not less than B control
 is transferred directly to the statement G=H.
 
      Next in complexity is the IF-ELSE statement, which is written
 
                    IF e [...] ELSE [...]                (A4.3-5)
 
 If e is true then the statements in the first block are executed
 and control is transferred to the statement following the second
 block.  If e is false then the statements in the second block
 are executed and control is transferred to the statement following
 the second block.  For example, consider
 
                       IF A.LT.B [C=D; E=F;]
                            ELSE   [G=H; I=J;]
                       K=L;
 
 If A is less than B the statements C=D and E=F are executed after
 which control is transferred to the statement K=L. If A is not
 less than B the statements G=H and I=J are executed after which
 control is transferred to the statement K=L.
 
 Consider
                          IF A.EQ.B [ X=Y;]
 
 Here the block to be executed, whenever A is equal to B, consists
 of the single statement X=Y;.  An alternate form acceptable in
 Mortran is the standard FORTRAN logical IF:
 
                           IF (A.EQ.B) X=Y;
 
      IF-ELSE statements may be nested to any depth.  Even so,
 the IF-ELSE is not really adequate (in terms of clarity) for
 some problems that arise.  For example, consider the following
 "case  analysis"  problem.  Suppose that we have four logical
 expressions
 
                    p, q, r, and s,
 
 and five blocks of statements
 
                    A, B, C, D, and E.
 
 Now suppose that p, q, r, and s are to be tested sequentially.
 When the first TRUE expression is found we want to execute the
 statements in the corresponding block (p corresponds to A,
 q to B, etc.) and then transfer control to the statement
 following block E.  If none of them is true we want to execute
 block E.  Using nested IF-ELSE statements we could write
 \end{verbatim}
\newpage
 \begin{verbatim}
                   IF p [A]
                   ELSE [ IF q [B]
                          ELSE [ IF r [C]
                                 ELSE [ IF s [D]
                                        ELSE [E]
                                      ]
                               ]
                        ]
 While this does what we want, it is awkward because each ELSE
 increases the level of nesting.  Mortran offers the ELSEIF
 statement as an alternative:
                         IF     p [A]
                         ELSEIF q [B]
                         ELSEIF r [C]                    (A4.3-6)
                         ELSEIF s [D]
                         ELSE     [E]
 Using ELSEIF instead of ELSE allows all the tests to be written
 at the same nest level.
 
      In summary, an IF statement may be optionally followed by any
 number of ELSEIF clauses which in turn may be optionally followed
 by a single ELSE clause.
 \end{verbatim}
 \subsubsection{Iteration}
 \index{Mortran3!iteration}
 \index{Mortran3!WHILE}
 \index{Mortran3!UNTIL}
 \begin{verbatim}
      A Mortran loop is a block which is preceded by, and
 optionally followed by, a "control phrase".  One such phrase is
 " WHILE e ".  One of the loops we may write with this phrase is
 
                         WHILE e  [...]                  (A4.3-7)
 
 The logical expression e is tested first.  If e is true the block
 is executed and then control is returned to test e again.
 When e becomes false, control is transferred to the first
 statement following the block.
 
      Another control phrase is " LOOP ".  If we wanted to test at
 the end of the loop instead of the beginning, we could write
 
                         LOOP [...] WHILE e ;            (A4.3-8)
 
 In (A4.3-8) the block is executed first.  Then, if the logical
 expression e is true, the block is executed again.  When e becomes
 false control is transferred to the statement following the loop
 (that is, the statement following the " WHILE e ;" ).
 
      The logical converse of the WHILE loop is the UNTIL loop.
                           UNTIL e  [...]                (A4.3-9)
 
 The logical expression e is tested first.  If e is false the block
 is executed and then control is returned to test e again.  When
 the logical expression becomes true, control is transferred to
 the first statement following the block.   Similarly, the logical
 converse of (A4.3-8) may be written by replacing the WHILE in
 (A4.3-8) by UNTIL.
 
      Tests for loop termination may be made at both ends of a
 loop.  For example, if e and f are logical expressions
 
                        WHILE e [...] UNTIL f ;
                        WHILE e [...] WHILE f ;
 
                        UNTIL e [...] WHILE f ;
                        UNTIL e [...] UNTIL f ;  ,
 
 all test at both the beginning and the end.  The above list is by
 no means exhaustive, but we must develop other "control phrases"
 in order to complete the discussion.
 
     The iteration control phrases discussed above do not involve
 "control variables"; that is, variables whose values are
 automatically changed for each execution of the loop.
 The following loop involves a control variable:
 
                  FOR  v = e  TO  f  BY  g  [...]        (A4.3-10)
 
 where v is the control variable and e, f, and g are arbitrary
 arithmetic expressions.  The control variable v must be of type
 REAL or INTEGER, and may be an array element (subscripted
 variable).  The value of any of the arithmetic expressions may
 be positve or negative.  Moreover, the magnitudes as well as the
 signs of f and g may change during the execution of the loop.
 
      The control variable v is set to the value of e and the test
 for loop termination (see below) is made.  If the test is passed
 then the block is executed, after which v is incremented by the
 value of g and control is returned to the test.  Note that the
 block is never executed if the test fails the first time.
 
      The "test" for the termination of a FOR-loop refers to the
 logical expression
                      g * (v-f) .GT. 0                   (A4.3-11)
\end{verbatim} 
\newpage \begin{verbatim}
 If the value of (A4.3-11) is true, then the test is said to have
 failed and control is transferred to the statement following the
 loop.  Multiplication by g in (A4.3-11) assures that loops in
 which the increment is (or becomes) negative will terminate
 properly.
 
      The "FOR-loop" (A4.3-10) has two alternate forms
               FOR v = e  BY  g TO f  [...]              (A4.3-12)
 and           FOR v = e  TO  f       [...]              (A4.3-13)
 
 In (A4.3-13) no increment is given, so it is assumed to be one.
 
      The iteration control phrase "DO I=J,K,N" also involves
 a control variable.  In this case I,J,K, and N must all be of
 type INTEGER and may not be array elements or expressions (these
 are the standard FORTRAN rules for DO-loops).  The following
 generates a standard FORTRAN DO-loop:
 
                    DO I=J,K,N [...]                     (A4.3-14)
 
      There is one exception to the rule that loops must be
 preceded by control phrases; namely, the compact DO-loop notation
 
                    [I=J,K,N;...]                        (A4.3-15)
 
 which generates a standard FORTRAN DO-loop.  This form permits
 compact notation for nests like
 
           [I=1,N1; [J=1,N2; [K=1,N3; A(I,J,K)=exp; ]]].
 
 (The use of the compact DO-loop notation is controversial;
 some people feel that it obscures the loop control.  If desired,
 it can be be removed from the language by deleting a single macro
 from the standard set).
 
      The Mortran FOR- and DO-loops apply only to blocks of
 statements, not to I/O lists.  The usual FORTRAN implied DO
 should be used within READ or WRITE statements.
 
      There remains one more type of loop to be discussed.  This
 loop is sometimes referred to as the "forever loop".  One writes
 the forever loop in Mortran by preceding a block with the phrase
 "LOOP":
                     LOOP [...] REPEAT                   (A4.3-16)
 or simply           LOOP [...]                          (A4.3-17)
\end{verbatim} 
\newpage \begin{verbatim}
 
 
 The block is executed and control is transferred back to the
 beginning of the loop.  The optional phrase "REPEAT" in (A4.3-16)
 is sometimes useful as a visual aid in locating the ends of
 deeply nested loops.
 
      A reasonable question might be:  "How do you get out of a
 forever loop?  Or, for that matter, any of the loops?".  One
 rather obvious way is to write
 
                            GO TO :CHICAGO: ;
 
 where the label :CHICAGO: is on some statement (or block) outside
 the loop.  If a convenient label doesn't already exist, creating
 one for the sole purpose of jumping out of the loop can be
 annoying and distracting.  For the case in which the jump is to
 the statement following the loop, the GO TO may be replaced by
 the Mortran "EXIT;" statement, which is written
 
                           EXIT;                         (A4.3-18)
 
 or, with a conditional statement
 
                       IF (e) EXIT;                      (A4.3-19)
 
 or                    IF  e  [...EXIT;]                 (A4.3-20)
 
 In any Mortran loop, the occurrence of the statement "EXIT;"
 causes a transfer of control to the first statement following
 the loop in which it occurs.
 
      A companion to the "EXIT;" statement is the "NEXT;"
 statement, which is written
 
                           NEXT;                         (A4.3-21)
 
 or, with a conditional statement
 
                       IF (e) NEXT;                      (A4.3-22)
 
 or                    IF  e  [...NEXT;]                 (A4.3-23)
\end{verbatim} 
\newpage \begin{verbatim}
 
 
 The occurrence of a "NEXT;" statement (which is short-hand for
 "go to the next iteration of this loop") in any Mortran loop
 causes a transfer of control to the beginning of the loop in which
 it occurs, incrementing the control variable (if any) before mak-
 ing the test for continuation in the loop.  In loops which test
 at both ends of the loop, only the test at the beginning of the
 loop is made; tests at the end of the loop are made only when the
 end of the loop is reached.  The tests of control variables in
 FOR- and DO-loops are considered to be at the beginning of the
 loop.
 
      Any Mortran loop may be optionally preceded by a label.  We
 will call loops which are preceded by labels "labeled loops".
 Any EXIT or NEXT statement may be optionally followed by a label.
 Any labeled loop may contain one or more statements of the form
 
                  EXIT :label: ;                         (A4.3-24)
 
 which transfers control to the first statement following the
 labeled loop.  For example EXIT :ALPHA:; would transfer control
 to the statement following the loop which had been labeled :ALPHA:.
 This transfer of control takes place regardless of nesting, and
 thus provides a "multi-level" EXIT capability.   The statement
 
                  NEXT :label: ;                         (A4.3-25)
 
 transfers control in the manner described above for the NEXT;
 statement.
 
      Suppose we have a nest of loops which search some arrays.
 The outer loop has been labeled :SEARCH:, and two of the inner
 loops have been labeled :COLUMN: and :ROW:.  Now we may write
 
   NEXT :ROW: ;    or    NEXT :COLUMN: ;   or    EXIT :SEARCH: ;
 
 when the transfer involves more than one level of nesting, or
 
                   NEXT;     or       EXIT;
 
 when only one nest level is involved.  Of course, the form
 
                       EXIT :label:;
 
 may also be used to exit a single level if desired.

 We can now summarize Mortran loops in the following chart:
 
          | WHILE a          |
          | UNTIL b          |    | NEXT;        |
          | LOOP             |    | EXIT;        |      | WHILE c; |
 |:label:|  FOR v=x BY y TO z [...| EXIT :label:;| ...] | UNTIL d; |
          | FOR v=x TO y BY z|    | NEXT :label:;|      | REPEAT   |
          | FOR v=x TO y     |
          | DO i=j,k,n       |
 
          where  a, b, c, and d are arbitrary logical expressions,
                 x, y, and z are arbitrary arithmetic expressions,
                 v is a subscripted or non-subscripted variable of
                    type INTEGER or REAL,
                 j, k, and n are non-subscripted INTEGER variables
                    or INTEGER constants, and
                 i is a non-subscripted INTEGER variable.
 
          | |  indicates "choose one",
          [ ]  indicates "optional", and

 \subsection{Miscellaneous Features}
 \subsubsection{Multiple Assignment}
 \index{Mortran3!multiple assignment}
 \begin{verbatim}
 
      It is sometimes useful to be able to assign the value of some
 expression or variable to several variables in a single statement.
 In Mortran one writes
 
                / p,q,r...,z / = e                       (A4.4-1)
 
 where p,q,r,...,z are variables and e is an expression.  The
 expression e assigned to each variable in turn.  For example,
 
          / I, A(I,K), J / = SQRT(X/2.0);
 
 produces the following FORTRAN statements:
 
          I = SQRT(X/2.0)
          A(I,K) = SQRT(X/2.0)
          J = SQRT(X/2.0)
 \end{verbatim}
 \subsubsection{I/O Abbreviations}
 \index{Mortran3!I/O abbreviations}
 \begin{verbatim}
      Another instance in which the creation of a label can be
 annoying because it is used only once and contains no mnemonic
 information is the following:
 
  READ (5,:NONSENSE:) i/o list;  :NONSENSE: FORMAT(format list);
 
 In Mortran one may write
 
               INPUT i-o list; (format list);            (A4.4-2)
 or            OUTPUT i-o list; (format list);           (A4.4-3)
 
 whenever the input or output is to the standard FORTRAN input or
 output units (5 and 6, respectively).  (If your FORTRAN compiler
 is already "extended" to allow the keywords INPUT and OUTPUT or
 if these keywords are already used in other contexts, the macros
 defining these statements may be removed or modified to use other
 keywords.  Similarly, the input and output units may be easily
 changed to units other than 5 and 6.)
 \end{verbatim}
 \subsubsection{Operators}
 \index{Mortran3!relational operators}
 \index{Mortran3!operators}
 \begin{verbatim}
      Relational operators (e.g., .LT. etc. in FORTRAN notation) may
 be denoted by:
 
           <, <=, =<, =, ~=, =>, >=, and >.
 
 Logical operators may be denoted by:
 
           & (and), | (or), and ~ (not).
 
 The usual FORTRAN notation is still valid, but one must NOT mix
 modes within a single statement (i.e., (A>B.AND.C>D) will be
 translated incorrectly.
 \end{verbatim}
 \subsection{User-Defined Macros}
 \index{Mortran3!macros}
 \index{Mortran3!user defined macros}
 \subsubsection{String Replacement}
 \index{Mortran3!string replacement}
 \begin{verbatim}
      Macro definitions are written in the following form:
 
        REPLACE {pattern} WITH {replacement}             (A4.5-1)
 
 Macro definitions are not statements and therefore need not be
 terminated by semicolons (if you put one in it will be ignored).
 Macro definitions are "free field" in the sense that you may
 write more than one definition on one line, or extend one
 definition to several lines.
 
      The pattern and replacement parts of a macro definition are
 character strings in the sense described in Section A4.2.  Since
 embedded strings are permitted in macro definitions, the usual
 rules regarding the doubling of apostrophes apply.
 
      The simplest kind of macro is one which contains neither
 parameters nor embedded strings.  For example, one could write
 
       REPLACE {ARRAYSIZE} WITH {50}                     (A4.5-2)
 
 after which all occurrences of the characters ARRAYSIZE in the
 program text would be replaced by 50.  For example,
 
          DIMENSION X(ARRAYSIZE); ... DO J=1,ARRAYSIZE [...]...
 
 would produce the same FORTRAN program as if
 
          DIMENSION X(50);...  DO J=1,50 [...]...
 
 had been written.
 
      Blanks are generally not significant when searching for
 occurrences of the pattern in the program text.  For example,
 the macro
            REPLACE {SIGMA(1)} WITH {SIGMA1}
 
 would match the program text
                     SIGMA (1)
 as well as
                     SIGMA(1)
      In some cases it is desirable to require that one or more
 blanks be present in the program text in order that a match occur;
 this can be done by writing a single blank in the pattern part of
 the macro.  For example the macro
 
       REPLACE {DUMP X;} WITH {OUTPUT X; (F10.2);}
 would match
                    DUMP X;
 but not
                    Y = DUMPX;
 
      Normally, the text generated by a macro is itself elegible
 for replacement by other macros, or even by the the same macro
 that generated the text.
 
 \end{verbatim}
 \subsubsection{Parameters in Macros}
 \index{Mortran3!parameters in macros}
 \begin{verbatim}
 
      The pattern part of a macro definition may contain up to
 nine formal (or "dummy") parameters, each of which represents a
 variable length character string.  The parameters are denoted by
 the symbol #.  For example,
 
              {EXAMPLE#PATTERN#DEFINITION}               (A4.5-3)
 
 contains two formal parameters.  The formal parameters are
 "positional".  That is, the first formal parameter is the
 first # encountered (reading left to right), the second formal
 parameter is the second # encountered and so on.  The corres-
 ponding actual parameters are detected and saved during the
 matching process.  For example, in the string
 
       EXAMPLE OF A PATTERN IN A MACRO DEFINITION        (A4.5-4)
 
 (assuming (A4.5-3) is the pattern to be matched), the first
 actual parameter is the string "OF A", and the second actual
 parameter is the string "IN A MACRO".  The parameters are saved
 in a "holding buffer" until the match is completed.
 
      After a macro is matched, it is "expanded".  The expansion
 process consists of deleting the program text which matched the
 pattern part of the macro and substituting for it the replacement
 part of the macro.
      The replacement part may contain an arbitrary number of
 occurrences of formal parameters of the form {Pi} (i=1,2,...,9).
 During expansion, each formal parameter {Pi} of the replacement
 part is replaced by the i-th actual parameter.  A given formal
 parameter may appear zero or more times in the replacement part.
 For example, the pattern part of the macro definition
 
       REPLACE {PLUS #;} WITH {{P1}={P1}+1;}             (A4.5-5)
 
 would match the program text
 
                   PLUS A(I,J,K);                        (A4.5-6)
 
 During the matching process the actual parameter A(I,J,K) is
 saved in the holding buffer.  Upon completion of the matching
 process (that is when the semicolon in the program text matches
 the semicolon in the pattern part), the "expansion" of the macro
 takes place, during which the actual parameter A(I,J,K) replaces
 all occurrences of the corresponding formal parameter, producing
 
                A(I,J,K)=A(I,J,K)+1;                     (A4.5-7)
 
 Note that the single formal parameter {P1} occurs twice in the
 replacement part and therefore the single actual parameter
 A(I,J,K) occurs twice in the resulting string.
 
      The program text which may be substituted for the formal
 (dummy) parameter is arbitrary except for the following
 restrictions:
 
      1. It may not be text containing an end-of-statement
         semicolon.  This restriction prevents "run-away" macros
         from consuming large parts of the program.
 
      2. Parentheses and brackets must be correctly matched
         (balanced). This facilitates the construction of macros
         which treat expressions as indivisible units.
 
      3. Quoted character strings are considered to be indivisible
         units. If the opening apostrophe of a character string is
         part of the actual parameter, then the entire string must
         be within the actual parameter.
 \end{verbatim}
 \subsection{Control Cards}
 \index{Mortran3!control cards}
 \begin{verbatim}
      More properly called "processor control directives",
 Mortran3 control cards may appear anywhere within the program
 and fall into two categories:
               1. Column-one-restricted directives
               2. Free-form directives
 
 Column-one-restricted directives MUST begin in column one and
 only one directive per line is recognized.  Free-form directives,
 on the other hand, may appear anywhere on a line and are not
 limited by number.  Some of both types have been found to be
 useful with the EGS4 Code System and they will be presented next
 [additional information is provided in A. J. Cook, "Mortran3
 User's Guide", SLAC Computation Research Group Technical Memor-
 andum CGTM-209 (1983)].
 \end{verbatim}
 \subsubsection{Column-One-Restricted Directives}
 \index{Mortran3!column one restricted directives}
 \begin{verbatim}
      Each of these control cards begins with a "%" in column 1,
 and should not contain embedded blanks or program text.
 Column 1
 |
 V
 %%   Signals end of Mortran input.  This is the ONLY control card
      that is required.  All others are optional.  Unlike Mortran2,
      %% signals the final end of input and must not be used to
      signal end of input from this particular unit.
 
 %F   Switch to FORTRAN mode (initial mode is Mortran).  While
      in FORTRAN mode, cards are read and written without any
      processing. This feature allows the interspersion of FORTRAN
      and Mortran text.  If this feature is used, all FORTRAN
      statement labels should be restricted to four digits
      (or less) in order to avoid possible conflict with Mortran
      generated statement labels, all of which are five digits
      long (in the default mode).
 
 %M   Switch back to Mortran mode (initial mode is Mortran).
 
 %E   Eject (start new page) in Mortran listing.
 
 %L   List (i.e., turn on Mortran listing (initally ON)).
 
 %N   Nolist (i.e., turn off Mortran listing).
 %In  Indent n places per nest level in Mortran listing, where
      n=0,1,2,...,99 (initally 0). (Note: leading blanks are
      automatically suppressed when n>0 so that "ragged" programs
      will be "straightened" by Mortran).
 
 %Cn  Set input line width to n, where n=10,11,...,80
      (initially n=72).  Characters in columns n+1 thru 80 will
      appear in the Mortran listing, but will be ignored by the
      processor.
 
 %An  Annotation mode switch.  Controls the generation of Mortran
      source as comments in the generated FORTRAN as follows:
 
      n=0 Suppress Mortran text in FORTRAN file (initially n=0).
 
      n=1 Interleave Mortran text as comments in the FORTRAN
          program starting in column 2 and extending through
          column 80.  If column 80 of the Mortran source line is
          not blank, a second comment line is generated containing
          the 80th character.
 
      n=2 Interleave the Mortran text as comments in the FORTRAN
          program in columns 40 thru 80.  Each Mortran source line
          will appear as two comment lines in the FORTRAN listing,
          each of which contains one half of the Mortran source
          line.
 
 %Qn  Quote switch (initally n=0).  Controls Mortran comments as
      follows:
      n=0 Comments must be fully enclosed in quotation marks (").
 
      n=1 All comments not closed at the end of each line will be
          closed by Mortran.
 
 %Un  Unit switch.  Causes Mortran to switch to FORTRAN input
      unit n for further input, where n=1,2,3...99.  When an
      end-of-file is read from unit n, input is switched back
      again to the unit from which the %Un was read.  If another
      %Un is read before an end-of-file, the current input unit
      is stacked and the Mortran input unit is again switched.
      This control statement provides a facility similar to that
      implemented in other languages by "COPY" or "INCLUDE"
      statements.   It is particularly convenient for introducing
      standard declarations, common blocks, or macro definitions
      from a predefined external file.
 \end{verbatim}
 \subsubsection{Free-Form Directives}
 \index{Mortran3!free form directives}
 \begin{verbatim}
      Free-form directives begin with an exclamation point
 ("bang!") and end with a semicolon.  The following are of
 particular use with EGS4/PEGS4:
 
 !ANNOTATE;    Interleave Mortran source in FORTRAN output.
               Mortran statements become COMMENTs in FORTRAN
               output. [!NOANNOTATE; means "Turn Off !ANNOTATE"].
 
 !COMMENTS;    Print Mortran comments as FORTRAN comments.
               Mortran comments are output to FORTRAN file with
               'C' in column one.  [!NOCOMMENTS; means "Turn
               Off !COMMENTS"].
 
 !INDENT Mn;   Set automatic indentation of Mortran listing to
               n columns per nesting level (same as %In above).
 
 !INDENT Fn;   Set automatic indentation of FORTRAN source to
               n columns per nesting level (like !INDENT Mn;).
 
 !INDENT Cn;   Set automatic indentation of FORTRAN comments to
               n columns per nesting level (but the 'C' remains
               in column one).
 
 !LIST;        Turn on Mortran listing.  Same as %L above.
               [!NOLIST; means "Turn Off !LIST;"].
 
 !LABELS n;    Reset FORTRAN statement label generator to n.
\end{verbatim}
