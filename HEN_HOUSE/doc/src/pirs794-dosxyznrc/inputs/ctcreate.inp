  CT Record 1          ctformat (A60)
                         The format of the CT data.  Currently Pinnacle,
                         CADPLAN and DICOM formats are handled for all
                         architectures.
                         AAPM format requires conversion to Pinnacle through
                         the $OMEGA_HOME/progs/ctcreate/CT/AAPM/aapm2pinnacle
                         code.

  CT Record 2          CTFilename (up to 256 characters)
                         For Pinnacle format:
                          CTFilename is the full name of the .header file.
                          Assumes that the binary CT data is stored in a file
                          with the same prefix but with a .img extension.
                         For CADPLAN and DICOM formats:
                          CTFilename is the full name of a file in which is
                          stored the full names of the CADPLAN data files
                          that make up the full CT image (one file/slice).
                          Files must be in order of increasing Z.

  CT Record 3          xctsubmin,xctsubmax,yctsubmin,yctsubmax,zctsubmin,
                       zctsubmax (6F10.4) (ON ONE LINE)

                       xctsubmin,xctsubmax: lower and upper x boundaries (cm)
                                            of the subset of the CT
                                            data to be considered for the
                                            dosxyznrc phantom.
                       yctsubmin,yctsubmax: lower and upper y bounds (cm)
                                            of the subset of the CT data
                                            to be considered for the dosxyznrc
                                            phantom.
                       zctsubmin,zctsubmax: lower and upper z bounds (cm)
                                            of the subset of the CT data
                                            to be considered for the dosxyznrc
                                            phantom.

                          If all are set to 0, then the entire CT volume
                          is selected.  If, in any dimension, the lower
                          bound is >= the upper bound, then the entire
                          thickness in that dimension will be used.  Finally,
                          note that the subvolume is always expanded to
                          include an integer number of CT voxels.

  CT Record 4          xyz_xthickness,xyz_ythickness,xyz_zthickness (3F15.0);
                       The x, y and z voxel dimensions (cm) to be used
                       for the dosxyznrc phantom.  Restrictions:
                          (xctsubmax-xctsubmin)/$IMAX<=xyz_xthickness<=
                                                      (xctsubmax-xctsubmin)
                          (yctsubmax-yctsubmin)/$JMAX<=xyz_ythickness<=
                                                      (yctsubmax-yctsubmin)
                          (zctsubmax-zctsubmin)/$KMAX<=xyz_zthickness<=
                                                      (zctsubmax-zctsubmin)

                         Note that voxel dimensions are always increased to
                         fit an integer number of dosxyznrc voxels on the CT
                         sub-volume selected.

  CT Record 5          num_material, material_ct_lower_bound (2I10)
                       num_material: This is the number of materials and ramps
                                     that are to be read from the file.
                       material_ct_lower_bound: lower CT no. for the first
                                                medium in the ramp.

                       If this input is 0,0 then the default CT ramp is used.
                       See subroutine CTToMedium for a description of the
                       default ramp.

                       If the default ramp is not used then the format for
                       user input of the materials and ramps
                       is shown in CT Records 6.a and 6.b.  These line pairs
                       are repeated num_material times.

  Repeat 6.a and 6.b for i=1 to num_material (only used if num_material > 0).

  CT Record 6.a        material_name (24A1)
                       The PEGS4 name of material i.

  CT Record 6.b        material_ct_upper_bound(i),
                       material_density_lower_bound(i),
                       material_density_upper_bound(i) (I5,2F15.0)
                       (all on one line)

                       material_ct_upper_bound(i): max CT no. for material i
                       material_density_lower_bound(i): min density for
                                                        material i (g/cm^3)
                       material_density_upper_bound(i): max density for
                                                        material i (g/cm^3)
