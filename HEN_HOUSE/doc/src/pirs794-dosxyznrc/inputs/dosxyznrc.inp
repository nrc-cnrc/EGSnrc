   A general purpose EGSnrc user code to do cartesian coordinate dose
   deposition studies. Every voxel (volume element) can have different
   materials and/or varying densities (for use with CT data).

   The geometry is a rectilinear volume with a right-handed coordinate system: 
   the X-Y plane on the page, X to the right, Y down and the 
   Z-axis into the page. Voxel dimensions are completely variable in
   all three directions. For more detail on geometry see subroutine HOWFAR

   DESCRIPTION OF INPUT FILE (on unit 5)                         
   =========================

  Record 1   TITLE     Up to 80 characters

  Record 2   NMED      Number of media in problem - defaults to 1
             If (NMED=0) then create dosxyznrc phantom from binary CT data 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------if NMED > 0  => non-CT data input---------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Record 3(NMED times) Media names, left justified. Note that
                       entire volume is initially set to medium 1

  Record 4  ECUTIN,PCUTIN,ESTEPM(i,i=1,NMED),SMAX
                ECUTIN,PCUTIN: Electron (total) and photon global cutoff
                      energies in MeV.  If ECUTIN > ECUT input in EGSnrc
                      parameters (See below), then ECUTIN is used.  The
                      same is true if PCUTIN > PCUT input in EGSnrc parameters.
                      ECUT and PCUT default to AE and AP, respectively.
                ESTEPM(i,i=1,NMED): Dummy input (used to be estepe, max. energy
                      loss/electron step in each medium)
                SMAX: Dummy input (used to be max. step length)
   
                ESTEPE and SMAX are now handled in EGSnrc inputs (See below),
                but the dummy inputs are retained for compatibility with 
                EGS4/DOSXYZ input files.

  Record 5   IMAX,JMAX,KMAX,IPHANT (4i10)
                IMAX,JMAX,KMAX: Number of voxels in the X,Y,Z directions
                       If < 0, it means that (-n) sets of equally spaced
                       boundaries will be input for that direction.
                IPHANT: set to 1 to output a .egsphant file for displaying
                       non-CT isodose contours using dosxyz_show 

  Record 6 et seq,     repeated for x, y and z directions separately
                       i.e. repeat the following replacing (i and x) by
                       (j and y) and (k and z) respectively
    if IMAX > 0
               input, one per record, the IMAX+1 x boundaries

    if IMAX < 0
               input smallest x boundary, followed by  abs(IMAX) pairs
               one pair/record: 
               voxel width, # voxels with this width

    For example, starting at record 5:
              -1,-1,-1
              0.0
              1.0,16
              0.0
              1.0,16
              0.0
              1.0,16
       defines a 16x16x16 cm cube of 1cm**3 voxels with a total of 4097 regions
    Or:
              -1,-1,2
              0.0
              1.0,16
              0.0
              1.0,16
              0.0
              5.0
              10.0
       defines a 16x16x10 cm cube with 1x1x5 cm voxels stacked 2 deep

   Record 7 et seq
             IL,IU, JL,JU, KL,KU, MEDIUM, DENSITY (7i10,f10.0)
             This record is repeated until a blank record is found.
             All regions default to medium 1 with its default density
             unless changed here.
             For all voxels with
                       IL <= i <= IU
                       JL <= j <= JU
                       KL <= k <= KU
             the medium and density are defined.
             If DENSITY=0.0, the default value for that
             MEDIUM is used (faster than entering default density here).
             If IU and IL are non-zero, the rest default to all j,k

   Record 8 et seq
             IL,IU, JL,JU, KL,KU, ECUTL, PCUTL (6i10,2f10.0)
             This record is repeated until a blank record is found.
             As above but allowing a region by region local definition
             of ECUT and PCUT.
             All regions default to the global values defined in
             record 4 unless changed here.
             Note, this option disabled, but must enter blank record
             for compatibility. Note old code is in place.

   Record 9 et seq
             IL,IU, JL,JU, KL,KU,IZSCAN,MAX20
             This record is repeated until a blank record is found.
             As above except these are the regions for which the
             dose will be printed in .egslst - beware of a paper explosion!
             The default is to print nothing unless asked for here.   
             IZSCAN is non-zero to get a z-scan per page, otherwise
             output is an x-scan per page.  If the input parameter
             MAX20 is equal to 1 on any of these input lines, a
             summary of the 20 highest doses is included in the output.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------if NMED = 0  input for a CT phantom ---------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Record 3  PhantFileName (A256)  : The full name of the file containing
                                     the CT phantom as output by ctcreate
                                     (should be a .egsphant file). 

   Record 4  ECUTIN,PCUTIN,SMAX (3F15.0)
                ECUTIN,PCUTIN: Electron (total) and photon global cutoff
                       energies in MeV.  If ECUTIN > ECUT input in EGSnrc
                       parameters (See below), then ECUTIN is used as the
                       global ECUT.  The same is true if PCUTIN > PCUT input 
                       in EGSnrc parameters.  ECUT and PCUT default to AE and
                       AP, respectively.
                SMAX: Dummy input (used to be max. step length)

                SMAX is now handled in EGSnrc inputs (See below),
                but the dummy input is retained for compatibility with
                EGS4/DOSXYZ input files.

   Record 5  zeroairdose,doseprint,MAX20 (3I5)

             zeroairdose: = 1 to zero the dose in air (any
                            material with density < 0.044 g/cm^3)

                          = 0(default) to not zero the dose in air
               doseprint: = 1 for output of all doses to

                          = 0(default) to suppress this output
                   MAX20: = 1 to print out summary of 20 highest
                            doses
                          = 0(default) no summary of these doses

                           phicol = 180 to retain same x,y positions passing
                           from BEAM to DOSXYZ  (because of coordinate
                           transformation used).
               i_dbs       set to 1 if you used directional bremsstrahlung 
                           splitting (DBS) in the BEAM simulation used to 
                           generate this phase space source AND you wish to 
                           reject fat photons not aimed into the splitting 
                           field.  These fat photons may compromise dose 
                           statistics.  Set to 0 otherwise.  
               r_dbs       DBS splitting radius used in BEAMnrc simulation(cm).
                           Set to 0 to disable this option.  Only needed if
                           i_dbs=1. 
             ssd_dbs       SSD at which r_dbs is defined in the BEAM sim. (cm).
                           Only needed if i_dbs=1.
               z_dbs       Z in the BEAMnrc run where the phase space source 
                           was scored (in cm).  Only needed if i_dbs=1.
             e_split       No. of times to split charged particles as soon
                           as they enter the DOSXYZnrc geometry.  Used in
                           conjunction with photon splitting (n_split) to
                           prevent higher-weight charged particles from
                           compromising dose statistics.  Recommended setting
                           is e_split=n_split for optimum efficiency.  Not
                           used if n_split<=1. 

      For i_dbs=1, photons are projected from z_dbs to ssd_dbs and if they will
      fall outside of r_dbs (based on their Z direction cosine) then they will
      be rejected.  This prevents fat photons from compromising dose 
      statistics.

     Note: as currently set, multiple passers and all particles going
           backwards in the phase space file are NOT used.

                           field.  These fat photons may compromise dose

                           conjunction with photon splitting (n_split) to
                           prevent higher-weight charged particles from
                           compromising dose statistics.  Recommended setting
                           is e_split=n_split for optimum efficiency.  Not
                           used if n_split<=1.

      For i_dbs=1, photons are projected from z_dbs to ssd_dbs and if they will
      fall outside of r_dbs (based on their Z direction cosine) then they will
      be rejected.  This prevents fat photons from compromising dose 
      statistics.

     Note: as currently set, multiple passers and all particles going
           backwards in the phase space file are NOT used.
     Also note that, similar to source 2, theta is the angle between the +z
     direction and a line joining the origin of the phase space plane to the
     isocenter, and phi is the angle between the +x direction and the
     projection of the line joining the origin of the phase space plane to
     the isocenter in the xy plane.

                      values (enflag=3), in which case NRCYCL is set to 0.
                      The calculated NRCYCL does not take into account
                      particles that are rejected because they miss the
                      geometry or because they are beyond the beam field
                      being considered (defined by BEAM_SIZE)
                      If NRCYCL is set > 0, then the user-input value is used.
                      If NCASE > no. of particles in the phase space file, 
                      then use of NRCYCL is essential for accurate statistics.
                      If you are unsure of how many times to recycle, use
                      the automatically-calculated value of NRCYCL.  If this
                      still results in many restarts (because of many
                      particles missing the geometry or beyond beam field),
                      then re-run the simulation with NRCYCL set manually to:
           NCASE/(NPHSP - NSMISS/NRCYCL_prev - NOUTSIDE - NRJCT - NDBSRJCT)-1
                      where NPHSP is the no. of particles of interest in the
                      the ph-sp file (ie total no. of particle, no. of photons,
                      no. of electrons), NSMISS is the no. of particles that
                      missed the geometry in the previous run, NRCYCL_prev is
                      the value of NRCYCL used in the previous run,
                      NOUTSIDE is the no. of particles rejected because they
                      were beyond BEAM_SIZE in the previous run, NRJCT
                      is the no. of particles rejected because they were
                      multiple passers, and NDBSRJCT is the number of photons
                      rejected because they fall outside the directional
                      bremsstrahlung splitting (DBS) field radius at the SSD
                      (see inputs for source 2,8 for more info on rejecting
                      fat photons when DBS is used in BEAM to generate phase
                      space files). All of the aforementioned values are 
                      available in the .egslst file.  Always round your 
                      calculated value of NRCYCL up.

   Note: the following 2 inputs are only relevant if you are manually
         creating/submitting your parallel jobs or if you are using the
         unix pprocess script.  In the case of the pprocess script, these
         inputs get set automatically.
 
          IPARALLEL   set >1 if you are distributing the job among IPARALLEL 
                      machines.  This will generate
                      a binary .pardose file for each job which will contain 
                      the doses in all voxels WITHOUT UNCERTAINTIES.  The 
                      stand-alone code, combinedose, will average the .pardose 
                      files and calculate the uncertainty and output the 
                      result in .3ddose format.  IPARALLEL defaults to 0.
            PARNUM    Only needs to be set if IPARALLEL>1 and you are using
                      a single phase space source.  The partition of the phase 
                      space source that will be used for this one of the 
                      series of parallel input files (for the same total 
                      simulation) is given by:
                       (PARNUM-1)*(nshist/IPARALLEL)<nnphsp<=
                                                (PARNUM)*(nshist/IPARALLEL)
                      where nshist is the total number of particles in the
                      phase space file and nnphsp is the number of the
                      particle chosen for the simulation.  Thus, PARNUM
                      should cover the range 1<=PARNUM<=IPARALLEL.  If you
                      are using a separate phase space source for each
                      parallel job (ie the phase space source exists in 
                      IPARALLEL pieces) and, thus, do not wish to partition
                      the phase space sources, PARNUM can be left at its
                      default value of 0. 

            n_split   If set > 1, then all photons will be split
                      n_split times.  This option increases the efficiency of 
                      dose caluclations more than photon forcing. 
                      A rule of thumb for good efficiency is
                         n_split >= No/(1-exp(-Lambda))
                      where Lambda is the approx. number of photon MFP
                      in the geometry of interest and No >= 5.
                      Note that if you use the above, there will
                      be on average approx. No primary interactions per
                      incident photon => reduce the number of
                      histories by this number.

        The n_split algorithm works as follows:
         * dpmfp_i = -log(1 - (eta+i)/n_split)
           where dpmfp_i is MFP to the next interaction for the i-th sub-photon
           eta is a random number (the same for all n_split sub-photons)
         * Once at the interaction site, the i'th sub-photon produces
           electrons and/or scattered photons. Scattered photons are
           killed with probability 1/n_split, so that, if they survive,
           they have the weight of the original photon. Electrons have the
           weight of 1/n_split of original weight.
         * In any radiative events (brems, annih, annih at rest), photons
           are killed with probability 1/n_split => they have again the
           weight of the photon that initiated the history, if they survive

        ihowfarless   Set to 1 to use the 'HOWFARLESS' algorithm for
                      transport in a homogeneous phantom.  When 'HOWFARLESS'
                      is used, subroutines HOWFAR and HOWNEAR only consider
                      the extreme outer boundaries of the phantom when 
                      calculating the distance along the particle trajectory
                      or nearest perpendicular distance to a region boundary.
                      This removes the restriction that charged particle
                      steps must stop at all voxel boundaries and, thus,
                      speeds up the calculation considerably.  For the purpose
                      of dose deposition in the voxels, the total curved
                      charged particle step is approximated using 2 straight-
                      line steps joined at a hinge point.  See the DOSXYZnrc
                      manual for more details about the approximation.
                      Restrictions on charged particle step length then become
                      the EGSnrc input variables Smax (max. allowable charged 
                      particle step length) and estepe (max. fractional energy
                      loss/step).  Leaving Smax set to its default value
                      of 5 cm should maximize efficiency of the 'HOWFARLESS'
                      algorithm at most beam energies.  Efficiency improvement
                      due to 'HOWFARLESS' depends on the incident beam type,
                      DOSXYZnrc voxel size and the boundary crossing algorithm
                      (BCA) used.  For incident photon beams from accelerators
                      simulated with BEAMnrc (phase space or BEAMnrc sim.
                      sources), the efficiency improves by ~30%
                      when the PRESTA-I BCA is used, and by factors of
                      2.5-3.5 when the more accurate (but slower) EXACT
                      BCA is used.  In monoenergetic electron beams, 
                      'HOWFARLESS' improves efficiency by a factor of up to
                      ~4 with the PRESTA-I BCA and by a factor of up to
                      ~15 with the EXACT BCA.  Recommended for all homogeneous
                      phantom calculations, but it must NOT be used in 
                      nonhomogeneous phantoms. 

         i_phsp_out   For outputting IAEA format phase space data on exit
                      from the phantom geometry.  If i_phsp_out=1, then data
                      is output in DOSXYZnrc coordinates.  If i_phsp_out=2
                      data is output in BEAMnrc coordinates.  This option is
                      only available for phase space or BEAM simulation
                      sources (which have a region surrounding the phantom).
                      The default is i_phsp_out=0--no phase space
                      output.  If you are using source 20 or source 21
                      (synchronized sources) then you also have the option of
                      storing frMU_indx in the file (see source inputs).

                          *************
    (modified from the description in $HEN_HOUSE/get_inputs.mortran)

  All input associated with selection of EGSnrc transport parameter
  is not crucial for the execution as there are default values set.
  Therefore, if some of the input options in this section are
  missing/misspelled, this will be ignored and defualt parameter assumed
  As the transport parameter input routine uses get_inputs, a lot
  of error/warning messages may be produced on UNIT 15, though.
  If you don't have the intention of changing default settings,
  simply ignore the error messages.

  Currently, the following options are available (case does not matter and
             the internal variables are shown in [ ] brackets):

       Global ECUT=     Global (in all regions) electron transport cut
                        off energy (in MeV). If this imput is missing,
                        or is < ECUTIN from the main DOSXYZnrc inputs
                        (See above) then ECUTIN is used for global ECUT.  
                        ECUT defaults to AE(medium).
                        [ ECUT ]
       Global PCUT=     Global (in all regions) photon transport cut
                        off energy (in MeV). If this imput is missing,
                        or is < PCUTIN from the main DOSXYZnrc inputs
                        (See above) then PCUTIN is used for global PCUT.
                        PCUT defaults to AP(medium). 
                        [ PCUT ]
       Global SMAX=     Global (in all regions) maximum step-size
                        restriction for electron transport (in cm).
                        No SMAX restriction is necessary if the electron
                        step algorithm is PRESTA-II and the EXACT boundary
                        crossing algorithm is used.  In this case, SMAX
                        will default to 1e10.  However, if either
                         Electron-step algorithm= PRESTA-I
                         or
                         Boundary crossing algorithm= PRESTA-I (the default),
                        then a step-size restriction is necessary, and
                        SMAX will default to 5 cm.
                        [ SMAXIR ]
       ESTEPE=          Maximum fractional energy loss per step.
                        Note that this is a global option only, no
                        region-by-region setting is possible. If missing,
                        the defualt is 0.25 (25%).
                        [ ESTEPE ]
       XImax=           Maximum first elastic scattering moment per step.
                        Default is 0.5, NEVER use value greater than 1 as
                        this is beyond the range of MS data available.
                        [ XIMAX ]
       Boundary crossing algorithm=
                        There are two selections possible: EXACT and
                        PRESTA-I.  PRESTA-I means that boundaries will
                        be crossed a la PRESTA.  That is, with lateral
                        correlations turned off at a distance given by
                        `Skin depth for BCA' (see below) from the boundary
                        and MS forced at the boundary.  EXACT means
                        the algorithm will cross boundaries in a single
                        scattering (SS) mode, the distance from a boundary
                        at which the transition to SS mode is made is
                        determined by `Skin depth for BCA' (see below).
                        Default is PRESTA-I for efficiency reasons. This
                        is known not to be exactly correct, and when charged
                        particle equilibrium does not hold or when there is
                        a large difference in size between dose voxels and
                        voxels making up the rest of the phantom, can result
                        in an overestimate of dose by up to 2.5%.  In such
                        cases, swich to EXACT BCA. 
                        [ bca_algorithm, exact_bca ]
       Skin depth for BCA=
                        If Boundary crossing algorithm= PRESTA-I (default)
                        then this is the distance from the boundary (in
                        elastic MFP) at which lateral correlations will be
                        switched off.  The default in this case is to 
                        calculate a value based on the scattering power at
                        ECUT (same as PRESTA in EGS4).  If
                        Boundary crossing algorithm= EXACT then this is
                        the distance from the boundary (in elastic
                        MFP) at which the algorithm will go into single
                        scattering mode and defaults to 3 mfp.
                        Note that if you choose EXACT boundary crossing and
                        set Skin depth for BCA to a very large number (e.g.
                        1e10), the entire calculation will be in SS mode.
                        If you choose PRESTA-I boundary crossing and make
                        Skin depth for BCA large, you will get default EGS4
                        behaviour (no PRESTA).

            Note that the above defaults have been choosen as a compromise
            between accuracy (EXACT BCA) and efficiency (PRESTA-I BCA)
            since the PRESTA-I BCA algorithm has proven to generally
            produce satisfactory results.  Note that the new transport
            mechanics of EGSnrc are maintained away from boundaries and
            that one always has the option of verifying the accuracy
            by doing a long run with the EXACT BCA.

       Bound Compton scattering=  On, Off or Norej (Default is On)
                        If Off, Compton scattering will be treated with

                          (if material is mixture) and the shell the photon
                          is interacting with are sampled from the
