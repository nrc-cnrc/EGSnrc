Introduction</h1>
<p>The C++ application <code>egs_chamber</code> is an advanced EGSnrc application derived from the <a class="el" href="cavity.html">cavity</a> application. It calculates the dose to the cavity of an ionization chamber and the dose ratios of two correlated geometries, i.e., which can be used for the computation of perturbation factors. Photon cross section enhancement (<em>XCSE</em>), intermediate phase-space storage (<em>IPSS</em>) of the properties of particles entering user deﬁned regions, and correlated sampling (<em>CS</em>) are combined in <code>egs_chamber</code> to dramatically improve the efficiency of ion chamber simulations. Details on the implementation of these techniques in <code>egs_chamber</code> can be found in [<em>Wulff, Zink, and Kawrakow, Med. Phys. 35 (4), 2008</em>] Motivation for this development was the fact that a Monte Carlo calculation of ion chamber ionization proﬁles inside a phantom irradiated by a large ﬁelds was still prohibitively long with existing tools such as the <code>cavity</code> application. Despite the improved efficiency achieved with the VRTs available in <code>cavity</code>, the calculation of perturbation factors and the calculation of ion chamber dose at more than one position inside a phantom was still extremely time consuming.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="egs_chamber_options"></a>
Scoring options</h1>
<p>As mentioned above, <code>egs_chamber</code> is particularly useful for the calculation of depth dose curves or a profile inside a phantom for a realistic ion chamber. In these cases it is recommended to select <em>IPSS</em> combined with <em>XCSE</em>. The implementation of <em>IPSS</em> requires a <em>base geometry</em> defining the phantom and an interior geometry acting as an imaginary envelope around the ion chamber at any of the desired positions in the phantom in a tight as possible manner (ion chamber is not included). This geometry is always the first <b><code>calculation geometry</code></b> defined in the <b><code>scoring options</code></b> input block. The phase-space of all particles entering this volume is recorded in a file and the transport in the base geometry terminated. All subsequent <b><code>calculation geometry</code></b> entries in this input block are considered to correspond to geometries with the ion chamber inside the phantom at different locations. The surrounding volume defined in the <em>base geometry</em> for <em>IPSS</em> is not included in these geometries. An example of such an input is shown below:</p>

</pre><p>The different input keys in this section should be easy to understand with the help of the explanatory text on the right-hand side. Each <b><code>calculation geometry</code></b> requires the input of the cavity regions and mass. Dose ratios can be calculated if requested using the <b><code>correlated geometries</code></b> input key. This is most efficiently used with the <em>CS</em> VRT (see below for more information).</p>
<p>Although the different VRT's implemented in <code>egs_chamber</code> are turned on or off in the <b><code>variance reduction</code></b> input block, the geometry specific parameters of these algorithms are defined in this section. Therefore, <code>egs_chamber</code> expects the geometry name for <em>range rejection based Russian Roulette</em> as well as the cross section enhancement regions and factors here and not in the <b><code>variance reduction</code></b> input block.</p>
<p>In the case of a large number of geometries, <em>input-loops</em>, a new feature in the egspp library, can be used to avoid typing the same stuff over and over again (see class reference <a class="el" href="classEGS__InputLoopVariable.html">EGS_InputLoopVariable</a> for more details using input loops). An example defining several geometries with input loops would be:</p>
<pre class="fragment">#
# The 3 chamber locations where the calculation geometries are named
# dose_-0.2cm, dose_0cm and dose_0.2cm and where the chamber is
# partially in the water phantom and partially in the air.

</pre><p>The implementation of the <em>CS</em> technique for the calculation of perturbation factors requires the definition of the names of the corresponding geometries and the geometrical regions within these geometries which are of a different material. It is obvious from the above that all these subgeometries will be geometrically identical and will only differ in the material in the user-defined regions. The required input is shown in the input block snippet below:</p>

Variance reduction techniques</h1>
<p>In addition to the VRTs implemented in cavity (see <a class="el" href="cavity.html#cavity_vr">Variance reduction techniques</a>) <code>egs_chamber</code> implements a combination of several VRTs to dramatically increase the in-phantom dose calculation efficiency for ionization chambers. These newly implemented VRT's in <code>egs_chamber</code> are :</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Photon cross-section enhancement</em> (XCSE): Increase of photon cross section by an enhancement factor resulting in the generation of more electrons along the path of the photons. The result is similar to the splitting technique also available in <code>egs_chamber</code>. However, the advantage of <em>XCSE</em> over <em>photon splitting</em> as implemented in <code>egs_chamber</code> is the ability to set different enhancement factors on a region by region basis.</li>
<li><em>Intermediate Phase-Space Scoring</em> (IPSS): stores the particles properties (energy, position, direction, etc.) at a defined boundary. This phase-space can be used for an arbitrary number of subsequent geometries. Useful for computing ion chamber dose at different phantom locations.</li>
<li><em>Correlated sampling</em> (CS): similar to <em>IPPS</em>, but scoring of the phase-space occurs in the user-defined regions corresponding to varying ion chamber's composition details and additionally stores the random number sequence and state. This maximizes correlation and decreases the statistical uncertainties in dose ratios. Used in the computation of perturbation factors.</li>
</ul>
<p>The input block for defining the input parameters of the VRT's looks like the following example: </p>
<pre class="fragment">:start variance reduction:
    cs enhancement = 1 # 0 (XCSE off), &gt;0 (XCSE on)
    TmpPhsp = 1   # i.e., score phase space and use it once in each specified
                  # sub-geometry
    :start range rejection:
        rejection = N_r
        Esave     = E_save # i.e. no range rejection but Russian Roulette
        cavity geometry = cavity # since each geometry can have its own
                                 # cavity geometry this is just a dummy
        rejection range medium = H2O521ICRU
    :stop range rejection:
:stop variance reduction:
</pre><p><em>Range based Russian Roulette</em> parameters are defined in input block <b><code>range rejection</code></b>. This technique is explained in detail in section <a class="el" href="cavity.html#cavity_vr">Variance reduction techniques</a> of the <code>cavity</code> manual. However it is worth noticing that in the case this VRT is used in different geometries, the <b><code>cavity geometry</code></b> entries are supplied in the <b><code>scoring options</code></b> input block for each <b><code>calculation geometry</code></b>. In this case, the <b><code>cavity geometry</code></b> here is still needed for initialization purposes and should correspond to an existing geometry. In conjunction with XCSE, the survival probability 1/N_r is used to split fat photons which survived RR when moving to a region with lowered XCSE factor. Thus rejection must be larger or equal to the largest XCSE factor used in the geometry.</p>
<p><em>XCSE</em> is turned on/off with the input key <b><code>cs enhancement</code></b> and requires the definition of enhancement regions as explained in section <a class="el" href="egs_chamber.html#egs_chamber_options">Scoring options</a>. These are usually all ion chamber regions and a slightly larger region (<em>shell</em>) surrounding the ion chamber. To turn on this VRT All regions with XCSE-factor <img class="formulaInl" alt="$\ne$" src="form_94.png"/> 1 must be specified in the input file and can be selected individually on a region-by-region basis. Table 1 in [<em>Wulff, Zink, and Kawrakow, Med. Phys. 35 (4), 2008</em>] gives optimum cylindrical shell thickness and XCSE factor for dose and <img class="formulaInl" alt="$P_{cel}$" src="form_95.png"/> or <img class="formulaInl" alt="$P_{wall}$" src="form_96.png"/> calculations for a Farmer ion chamber. As a rule of thumb, a 1 cm shell thickness is an optimal choice for dose calculations. For perturbation factors, thinner shells are more appropriate. When using different XCSE factors, one should make sure that the larger factors are divisible without remainder by the smaller factors (e.g. 2, 4, 8, 16 etc.).</p>
<p><b>Beware</b> of possible fluctuations of the variance when a very thin shell surrounding the cavity whith a high XCSE factor is used. Fluctuations in statistical uncertainty will be caused by the contribution to the cavity dose of a bunch of almost identical electrons after splitting a fat electron from outside the XCSE region. This will have the same effect on the statistics as the contribution from the fat electron.</p>
<p><em>IPSS</em> is turned on/off by means of the input key <b><code>TmpPhsp</code></b>. Setting <b><code>TmpPhsp</code></b> to 0 turns this VRT off and greater than 0 turns <em>IPSS</em> on. If <b><code>TmpPhsp</code></b> is greater than 1, then it indicates the number of times to recycle the phase space. For this reason it must be a divisor of the XCSE factors. <b>However</b>, no gain in efficiency has been observed for <b><code>TmpPhsp</code></b> larger than 1. When <em>IPSS</em> is turned on, the first geometry inside the <b><code>scoring options</code></b> section is assumed to be the <em>base</em> geometry and a phase-space is scored whenever particles enter the defined cavity region of this geometry. Particle transport is discarded and as a result, no dose is scored for the first geometry. All subsequent calculation geometries use this phase-space as a particle source. It should be evident that any required affine transformation related with the original source needs to be only applied to the first geometry. Any affine transformation defined in the subsequent geometries will only affect the particles in the phase space.</p>
<p>As mentioned in section <a class="el" href="egs_chamber.html#egs_chamber_options">Scoring options</a>, <em>CS</em> parameters are defined in the <b><code>scoring options</code></b> input block and no input is required in the <b><code>variance reduction</code></b> input block. While these parameters help define the phase space scoring volume, in order to compute the actual perturbation factors one must make use of the <b><code>correlated geometries</code></b> input key in the <b><code>scoring options</code></b> input block to obtain the dose ratio of the relevant geometries in the following way:</p>
<pre class="fragment">    :start calculation geometry:
        .
        .
        .
        subgeometries   = sub_1 sub_2 ... sub_n

</pre><h1><a class="anchor" id="egs_chamber_labels"></a>
Region labels</h1>
<p>Tired of updating your lists of region numbers every time you change the geometry? Those days are over! Introducing: region labels.</p>
<p>With region labels you can set a label to point to <em>local</em> region numbers in a geometry. When you use the label, the corresponding <em>global</em> region numbers will be determined and substituted.</p>
<p>In short, insert a <b><code>set label =</code></b> line into the geometry that contains your region(s) of interest. In the example below, notice that we set the label named <b><code>mySphere1Label</code> </b> to the local region 0. This region number is what you would expect if you loaded only <b><code>sphere1</code> </b> as your <em>simulation geometry</em>. Since there is only 1 sphere, there is only a single local region (indexed from 0), so we set the label to 0.</p>
<p>To include many local regions, just use a space separated list (e.g. 0 1 3 5).</p>
<pre class="fragment">    :start geometry:

<p>As any other EGSnrc application, <code>egs_chamber</code> can be started from the command line using </p>
<pre class="fragment">egs_chamber -i input_file -p pegs_file [-o output_file] [-b] [-s] [-P N -j i]
</pre><p> where the arguments in square brackets are optional. With the <b><code>-o</b></code> option one can change the name of the output files (by default <b><code>input_file.xxx</b></code> is used, where <b><code>xxx</b></code> is <b><code></code>.egslog</b> for the log file, <b><code></code>.egsdat</b> for the data file, etc.). With <b><code>-b</b></code> one specifies a "batch" run, <em>i.e</em>. the output is redirected to <b><code>output_file.egslog</b></code>. With <b><code>-s</b></code> one can force <code>egs_chamber</code> to use a simple RCO instead of a JCF-RCO in parallel runs specified with <b><code>-P N -j i</code></b>, where <b><code>N</b></code> is the number of parallel jobs and <b><code>i</b></code> the job index. Note that one Unix-type systems it is easier to use the <b><code>exb</b></code> command to submit parallel jobs </p>
<pre class="fragment">exb egs_chamber input_file pegs_file [p=N] [batch=pbs]
</pre><p> where the <b><code>batch</b></code> option specifies the queuing system to be used. The EGSnrc GUI can of course be also used, see see PIRS-877 for more details on running EGSnrc applications.</p>

#
#  An example input file for egs_chamber.
#
#  This file defines an egs_chamber simulation of a farmer type chamber
#  positioned at different depths in and above a 30x30x30 cm water phantom.
#  An example of how to use a BEAMnrc simulation source is presented but
#  not used. Actual calculation source is a 10 cm X 10 cm 2 MeV photon beam.
#  The scoring plane of the BEAMnrc simulation is just below the photon jaws
#  at z=50 cm from the target, i.e., the air between the jaws and the water
#  surface at z=100 cm is included in the egs_chamber simulation. The XCSE
#  technique is used combined with phase-space scoring for particles entering
#  a rectangular 'tube' that encloses all chamber locations. Instead of using
#  a transformed geometry to position the chamber at different depths, the
#  chamber location is held fixed at 0 cm depth and the phantom+air slab is
#  moved up and down. This is accompanied with a corresponding transformation
#  of particle positions between transport in each geometry. The advantage of
#  using this approach is that the transformation is applied once per particle
#  track per geometry, whereas a transformed geometry approach requires the
#  transformation to be applied for each geometry related computation
#  (i.e., at least once per particle step).

Calculation of positioning-induced dose uncertainties.</h1>
<p>An option has been added to the <b><code>scoring options</code></b> input block of <code>egs_chamber</code> that allows the estimation of experimentally positioning-induced dose uncertainties. This option is useful in situations where it is not possible to evaluate this type of uncertainty by experimental means. Isocenter and cavity positioning can be defined independently each using 6 degrees of freedom: 3 for translations (x,y,z) and 3 for rotations (thetax,thetay,thetaz). For each type of positioning, the user-defined parameters are distribution type, maximum shift, sigma (for Gaussian distributions only), the number of cases per position (M) and the number of positions per history (N).</p>
<p>The implemented statistical estimator is unbiased and possibly yields negative values. Hence it is crucial that the user optimizes the parameters N and M to make the simulation efficient for each individual dosimetric situation (even if one changes only position or field size). When optimizing these parameters, it is recommended to set the number of positions per sample to the minimum (N = 2) and then optimize the number of cases per position (M) using the efficiency indicator output with the simulation results. Once the optimal M is found, one can increase N so that a reasonable number of histories per sample (NM) is obtained. The uncertainty on the estimation of positioning-induced dose uncertainty is calculated from K samples, such that the total number of histories simulated is equal to NMK. It is recommended to verify that the number of histories per sample NM is such that each batch contains enough histories to calculate a sample, otherwise the result will come out undefined. Therefore the user must check that the number of histories per batches is greater than NM. This can be a limiting factor when using parallel runs if the job splitting number is large. When using a source library or a particle phase-space the number of particles per history can be larger than one. In these cases the number of histories per batch should be greater than NM times a factor depending on the source. For these sources it is recommended to perform check runs.</p>
<p>The geometry must be carefully defined such that the particle does not enter the cavity or exit the phantom when it is randomly transformed. It must also be ensured that the particle remains in a homogeneous scoreless region during that process. For that reason, the isocenter option must be used with an additional layer of material (vacuum or air) above the phantom. The particle's starting position should be defined inside this layer, not at a boundary. The random tranformation should leave the particle inside this additional layer. The cavity option must be used with the TmpPhsp option, since it is used to randomly transform the particle's position from the TmpPhsp volume envelope. The TmpPhsp volume must be:</p>
<ol>
<li>
large enough to avoid all possible shift of the particles to reach the scoring volume or inhomogeneous boundaries </li>
<li>
far enough from the water surface so that the particle transformations do not carry the particle outside of the phantom or through inhomogeneous boundaries. </li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, when using the cavity positioning option, it is recommended that the scoring volume is located at least 5 cm below the water surface, otherwise the calculation will simulate detector motion inaccurately.</p>
