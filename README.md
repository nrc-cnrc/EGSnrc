## What is EGSnrc?

EGSnrc is a software toolkit to perform Monte Carlo simulation of
ionizing radiation transport through matter. It models the propagation
of photons, electrons and positrons with kinetic energies between
1&nbsp;keV and 10&nbsp;GeV, in homogeneous materials. EGSnrc was originally
released in 2000, as a complete overhaul of the Electron Gamma Shower (EGS)
software package originally developed at the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) in the 1970s. Most notably, EGSnrc incorporates crucial
refinements in charged particle transport, better low energy cross
sections, and the egs++ class library to model elaborate geometries and
particle sources.
