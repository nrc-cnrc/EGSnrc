## What is EGSnrc?

EGSnrc is a software toolkit to perform Monte Carlo simulation of
ionizing radiation transport through matter. It models the propagation
of photons, electrons and positrons with kinetic energies between
1&nbsp;keV and 10&nbsp;GeV, in homogeneous materials. EGSnrc is an
extended and improved version of the Electron Gamma Shower (EGS)
software package originally developed at the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) in the 1970s. Most notably, it incorporates significant
refinements in charged particle transport, better low energy cross
sections, and the egs++ class library to model elaborate geometries and
particle sources.

verbatim or modified versions of the code, or any work based on any
EGSnrc component (including any such work operated remotely over a
network), you must do so under the same licence terms. Please
[contact NRC](http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/solutions/advisory/egsnrc_index.html)
if you wish to licence EGSnrc under different terms.


## Installation

EGSnrc can be installed on computers running Linux, macOS or Windows. Please
read the [installation instructions](https://github.com/nrc-cnrc/EGSnrc/wiki/Installation-overview)
for details on how to download and properly configure EGSnrc on your operating system.

## Contributing

You can contribute to the EGSnrc project by implementing new features, creating
new data sets, correcting errors, or improving documentation. For small
corrections and improvements, feel free to
[submit an issue](https://github.com/nrc-cnrc/EGSnrc/issues). For more extensive
contributions, familiarize yourself with git and github, work on your own EGSnrc
project fork and open a
[pull request](https://github.com/nrc-cnrc/EGSnrc/issues). Note that significant
contributions will require a transfer of copyright to the National Research
