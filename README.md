## EGSnrc port to github and AGPL 3.0 licence

EGSnrc is currently being ported to this github repository to be released
under the the AGPL 3.0 open-source license. Most of the EGSnrc files
have been transferred to this repository, however the distribution is not
yet functional, and consequently the open source release has not yet been
officially announced. It is recommended that you wait until the official
release before cloning or forking this repository.
